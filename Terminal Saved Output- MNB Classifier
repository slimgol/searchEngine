United \nStates, it is emerging again among the homeless, AIDS  patients, immigrants, \nminorities, and prisoners.  Dr. Lee B.  Reichman, professor of medicine at the \nUniversity of New Jersey  Medical School and president of the American Lung \nAssociation,  said, "Right now, it\'s a big city problem, but potentially it\'s  \neveryone\'s problem."  The ALA predicts that 10 million Americans  are infected \nwith TB, and about 10 percent of them will develop  the disease because their \nimmune systems are depressed,  especially those with AIDS or HIV.

State health officials believe the TB is also  spreading because \nthose who are most susceptible are the least  likely to follow through with \ntreatment.  In addition, the  increase is attributed to a shortage of public \nhealth services.   In New York City, TB is an epidemic "because the number of \ncases  is increasing faster than we can treat people," said Dr. George  \nDiferdinando, director of the New York State TB Control.   According to \nDiferdinando, curbing the spread of TB entails  keeping 85 percent or more of \ndiagnosed TB cases in treatment.   About 40 percent of infected New York City \nresidents don\'t  complete therapy.  When TB patients don\'t finish taking their  \nmedication, multi-drug resistant TB can develop, which requires  taking more \nexpensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to \ntreat.\n ================================================================    \n "Increasing Frequency of Heterosexually Transmitted AIDS in  Southern \nFlorida: Artifact or Reality?" American Journal of Public Health (04/93) Vol. \n83, No. 4, P. 571  (Nwanyanwu, Okey C. et al.) \n\n     The alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired AIDS cases in \nsouthern Florida was partially related to misclassification of  risk, write \nOkey C. Nwanyanwu et al. of the Centers for Disease  Control in Atlanta, Ga.  \nThe researchers investigated 168 such  AIDS cases from Broward and coastal \nPalm Beach counties.  All of  these cases attributed to heterosexual \ntransmission reported  sexual contact with bisexual men, injecting drug users, \nor  persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the  primary route \nof HIV transmission.  Medical records of patients,  in addition to records \nfrom social services, HIV counseling and  testing centers, and sexually \ntransmitted disease (STD) clinics  were reviewed.  If no other HIV risk factor \nwas found from  medical record review, patients were interviewed using a  \nstandardized questionnaire.  Once STD clinic and other medical  records were \nreviewed, 29 men and 7 women were reclassified into  other HIV transmission \ncategories.  After adjustments were made  for the reclassification, the \npercentage of AIDS cases reported  from Palm Beach and Broward counties \nbetween January 1, 1989, and March 31, 1990, that was attributed to \nheterosexual transmission  decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent among men \nand from 33  percent to 28 percent among women.  While the percentage of  \nheterosexually transmitted AIDS cases in southern Florida  decreased after \nadjustment was made for reclassified cases, it  still remained above the \nnational average, the researchers  conclude.\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n                                AIDS Statistics\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n                            World Health Organization, Geneva\n                        Organisation mondiale de la Sante, Geneve\n\n                              WEEKLY EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RECORD\n                           RELEVE EPIDEMIOLOGIQUE HEBDOMADAIRE\n\n15 January 1993 -

We grew\nup in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles,\nnuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  But these were\nmiracles of our parent\'s doing.  For a decade and more the pundits\nhave told us - "you\'ve lost it!"  The "me" generation is only\nliving on the accomplishments of the past.\n\n     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We\nlisten in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living\nhistory they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell\nof it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as\nGeneral Bernie Schriever told of his team\'s work - and yes struggle\n- to build this nation\'s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.\n\n     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand\ndollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only\nof that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.\nSchriever\'s ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the\nbest new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and\nPoseidon ballistic missiles.\n\n     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. \nThis event is proof.  To our technological parents: We\'ve listened\nto your stories.  We\'ve caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. \nAnd we\'ve learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let\nme honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus\nbehind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest\nengineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your\ninsight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated\ninto today\'s most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.\n\n     You told us in the 60\'s that a new form of launch vehicle - a\nsingle stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You\nadvocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are\nall great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You\nconvinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld\nits components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a\nprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the\ngeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinental\naviation in the 1920\'s and 30\'s - build a little and test a little\nand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who\nstarted this program for the SDI.\n\n     Douglas Aircraft didn\'t start with a DC-10.  They didn\'t even\nstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a\nlittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before they\nmoved on to the next step.  They didn\'t take a decade or more\nbefore putting the first "rubber on the road."  Max Hunter - you\ndidn\'t take ten years to build Thor, and by God we\'re not going to\ntake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable\naerospace transportation is real.\n\n     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same\nteam here today but a few years to show through the Strategic\nDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -\nlaunched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about\na year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our\ncommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet\nUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored\nthe importance of our work in bringing about a new international\nrelationship.\n\n     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the\nframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the\nnext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.\n\n     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This\nsummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the\nfirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three\nyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space\nrapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And\nyes - we\'ll make a little money off it too!\n\n     Then - and only then - we\'ll spend another three years to\nbuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of\nspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the\nrocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. \nWhat a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to\ncounter SDI merge to power mankind\'s next step to the stars!\n\n     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to\nthe final answer.  Robert Goddard\'s first rockets weren\'t Saturn\nV\'s!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra\ndollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital\nsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the\nway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket\nexhausts.  There is no short-cut.

In 1985\nthe New York Times reported that government investigators broke\nup a narcotics ring that was operating highly sophisticated\nequipment capable of allowing the leaders of the ring to\neavesdrop on the law-enforcement agents who were trying to arrest\nthem.\n     A Mr. Deely, an NSA official, said "There are a lot of\nmedium-sized countries that would have been proud to have the\nsignals intelligence operation of this group."\n     For every John Gotti there are probably many more people who\nhave the sophistication to know what the risks of unsecure\ncommunications are.  The press given to the Big Brother chip will\nonly increase their numbers.\n     Even if there is some benefit to law-enforcement through the\nuse of Big Brother, it must be weighed against the constitutional\nand civil liberties questions involved.\n     For example, in some areas of the world torture is used as\nan investigative tool by the local "law-enforcement" people.  I\nsuspect it is an effective means of obtaining information and\nshortening many investigations.  It probably also helps keep the\nconviction rate high.\n     The fact that the torture tool is not used in this country\n(even with a court order obtained by showing "probable cause") is\nbecause we have rightly balanced the questions of expediency and\nwhat is ethically and morally right.\n     I think that the same question of expediency versus morality\nshould come into play when considering the use of Big Brother.  I\nvote for morality.\n     I am quite disturbed by what I interpret as a veiled threat\nto prohibit the use of all encryption if this Big Brother chip is\nnot put into wide spread use.  After a quick reading of the White\nHouse press release I came away with that impression.\n     To most of the American public, the word "hacker" has\nrightly or wrongly come to mean "high tech adolescent vandal".\nIt has struck me that most of the people posting to sci.crypt\nregarding this issue are intelligent, thoughtful individuals who\nhave genuine concerns about the privacy and constitutional issues\nsurrounding Big Brother.

Others claim to be staying of their own free\nwill, but Jobs\' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm.\n\nIn conversations with authorities, Jobs has given conflicting\ninformation on how heavily prepared the group is for war with the\nindustry.  At times, he has claimed to "have hardware which will blow\nanything else away", while more recently he claims they have stopped\nmanufacturing their own.\n\nAgents from the ATF (Apple-Taligent Forces) believe that the group is\nequipped with serious hardware, including 486-caliber pieces and\npossibly Canon equipment.\n\nThe siege has attracted a variety of spectators, from the curious to\nother cultists.  Some have offered to intercede in negotiations,\nincluding a young man who will identify himself only as "Bill" and\nclaims to be the "MS-iah".\n\nFormer members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speak\nhesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work\n20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.

The Jets\nlooked more dangerous in this one but it didn't make a difference in the \nnumbers that counted: goals.\n\tVancouver's big line produced again, with centre Cliff Ronning and\nleft winger Geoff Courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to \nboost the Canucks to a 2-0 lead on giveaways by the suspect Jet defence of\nBautin and Ulanov. Mental lapses by the defence and goal-scoring talent\nin opportune areas made the difference in all three Canuck goals.\n\tHowever, as in the first game, the Jets worked hard to take the\ngame to the Canucks in the second period. The Jets dominated the second,\nchecking hard and penetrating the Vancouver zone without being challenged\nby a Canuck team that wanted to pack it in early. \n\tThe hard work paid off late in the second, when Tie Domi caught\nVancouver goalie Kirk McLean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make\nthe score 2-1. \n\tDomi's goal gave the Jets new life as they began to take the rush\nto the Canuck's collapsing defence. The Canucks were unwilling to do \nanything but let McLean take shots and clear the rebounds. The Jets were\nallowed to set up and make plays.\n\tBoth goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably.\nMcLean made three great saves in the second off a dancing Teammu Selanne\nwhile Essensa was rocked by a Pavel Bure drive. Selanne looked dangerous\non the rush as the Jets pressed a series of attacks into the Canuck\nzone. The Canucks, on the other hand, looked like they were offering four\nchecking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead.\n\tA series of minor penalties at the end of the second period\nresulted in a one man advantage for the Jets in the early third. The\nJet's Tempo Numminen drove a puck from the point through McLean's\nlegs and into the net to tie the game at 2-2.\n\tThe Canuck's discordant play picked up where it left off.\nThis was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected\nor were picked off by the Jets and individual rushes into a tight\nWinnipeg defence that were never supported.\n\tHowever, as in the first and second Canuck goals, a Jet defensive\nlapse (re: bonehead play) stalled the Winnipeg comeback. With the faceoff\nin the Winnipeg zone, Pavel Bure was left to stand in the crease with\nno Jet defender anywhere near him. Bure, who had been invisible in the\ngame up to that point, took a rebound and managed to roof it with a \nbackhand even though he was off balance. \n\tBy then it was too late for the Jets to come back. Essensa made it\nto the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing\nfor their attack.

Rather than use technology to accommodate\nthe sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and\nlaw enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against\nindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.\n\nSophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to\nprotect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to\nprotect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption\ntechnology can help Americans protect business secrets and the\nunauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used\nby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.\n\nA state-of-the-art microcircuit called the "Clipper Chip" has\nbeen developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a\nnew approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,\nrelatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to\nan ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications\nusing an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in\ncommercial use today.\n\nThis new technology will help companies protect proprietary\ninformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations\nand prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted\nelectronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the\nability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to\nintercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. \n\nA "key-escrow" system will be established to ensure that the\n"Clipper Chip" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding\nAmericans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique\n\n\n                                2\n\n\n"keys," numbers that will be needed by authorized government\nagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the\ndevice is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately\nin two "key-escrow" data bases that will be established by the\nAttorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to\ngovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct a\nwiretap.\n\nThe "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with no\nnew authorities to access the content of the private\nconversations of Americans.\n\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the\nAttorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new\ndevices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the\ngovernment will be offered access to the confidential details of\nthe algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report\ntheir findings.\n\nThe chip is an important step in addressing the problem of\nencryption\'s dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the\nprivacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield\ncriminals and terrorists.  We need the "Clipper Chip" and other\napproaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access\nto the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it\nto hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology\ntrends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),\nthe President has directed government agencies to develop a\ncomprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:\n\n     --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to\n          employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;\n\n     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone\n          calls and data, under proper court or other legal\n          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;\n\n     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern\n          technology to build the National Information\n          Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and\n          the competitiveness of American industry in the global\n          marketplace; and \n\n     --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export\n          high technology products.\n\nThe President has directed early and frequent consultations with\naffected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the\nprivacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.\n\n\n\n                                3\n\nThe Administration is committed to working with the private\nsector to spur the development of a National Information\nInfrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer\ntechnologies to give Americans unprecedented access to\ninformation.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks\n("information superhighways") will transmit video, images, HDTV\nprogramming, and huge data files as easily as today\'s telephone\nsystem transmits voice.\n\nSince encryption technology will play an increasingly important\nrole in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act\nquickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding\nits use.  The Administration is committed to policies that\nprotect all Americans\' right to privacy while also protecting\nthem from those who break the law.\n\nFurther information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. \nThe provisions of the President\'s directive to acquire the new\nencryption technology are also available.  \n\nFor additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of\nStandards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.\n\n---------------------------------\n\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION\'S\nTELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE\n\n\n\n\nQ:   Does this approach expand the authority of government\n     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?\n\nA:   No.  "Clipper Chip" technology provides law enforcement with\n     no new authorities to access the content of the private\n     conversations of Americans.\n\nQ:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\n     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\n     encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\n     decipher the message?\n\nA:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\n     court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They\n     would then present documentation of this authorization to\n     the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and\n     obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug\n     smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are\n     stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key\n     escrow system.\n\nQ:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?\n\nA:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent\n     entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the\n     Administration have yet to determine which agencies will\n     oversee the key-escrow data banks.\n\nQ:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure\n     how strong the security is?  \n\nA:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption\n     systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will\n     remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow\n     system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of\n     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all\n     potential users that there are no unrecognized\n     vulnerabilities.\n\nQ:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?\n\nA:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the\n     Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in\n     this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the\n     President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet\n     officials.\n\nQ:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?\n\nA:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on\n     encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify\n     as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have\n     briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the\n     decisions related to this initiative.\n\nQ:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?\n\nA:   The government designed and developed the key access\n     encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the\n     microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product\n     manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip\n     manufacturer that produces them.\n\nQ:   Who provides the "Clipper Chip"?\n\nA:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,\n     California, and will sell the chip to encryption device\n     manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed\n     to other vendors in the future.\n\nQ:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices? \n\nA:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating\n     the "Clipper Chip" into their devices.\n     \nQ:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological\n     solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be\n     willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more\n     powerful encryption devices?\n\nA:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be\n     considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow\n     mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product\n     that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive\n     than others readily available today, but it is just one\n     piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to\n     encryption technology, which the Administration is\n     developing.\n\n     The Administration is not saying, "since encryption\n     threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,\n     we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have\n     effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that "every\n     American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an\n     unbreakable commercial encryption product."  There is a\n     false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is\n     an "either-or" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,\n     and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,\n     balanced approach such as is proposed with the "Clipper\n     Chip" and similar encryption techniques.\n\nQ:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton\n     Administration\'s policy toward encryption will differ from\n     that of the Bush Administration?  \n\nA:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption\n     technology in telecommunications and computing and are\n     committed to working with industry and public-interest\n     groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans\'\n     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law\n     enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime\n     and terrorism.\n\nQ:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use\n     the government hardware?\n\nA:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control\n     requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is\n     required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The\n     same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the\n     attractions of this technology is the protection it can give\n     to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this\n     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a\n     case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these\n     devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan\n     to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability\n     of these products.\n\n \n     ', "\nSo what's your local hospital's favorite curse?", '\nPC Magazine, January 12, 1993 had a review of several personal finance\nmanagement programe, as did PC-Computing, January 1993.

Although two months\n have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs, I\n have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at \n almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from\n Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly\n slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to\n save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful\n events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then\n taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people \n well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these\n places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.\n They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the\n Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality\n problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers\n who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and\n Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the \n Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs. \n I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is \n destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are \n speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as \n well, I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is \n proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war."\n\n                                                     Dr. Stephan Eshnanie\n\nSerdar Argic', 'Reply to haljordan@delphi.com or call 708 674-2603:', '', '\n\n: medtronic.COM (Dale M.

And thank you for an intelligent response devoid of the silly\nname-calling of others.  :)\n\n\n One of the basic things you need to \n\nOK.\n\n\nActually, I think the large-scale sample size is part of the problem.\nIt seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball\nin regard to BA vs. Clutch BA deviation we would get some kind of\nbell curve.  (The X-axis being the +/- deviation in clutch hitting\nvs. non-clutch;  the Y-axis being the number of players.)  Certainly\nthere would be *some* players on the extreme ends of the bell.  My\n*supposition* is that if we were to find the SAME players consistently\n(year after year) at one end of the bell or the other, then we might\nbe able to make some reasonable conclusions about *those* players\n(as opposed to all baseball players).\n\n  As a counterexample to \n\nYou won't hear those kind of accusations from me.  It is interesting\nthat you selected Maldonado, because he is someone whom I have also \nlooked at.  He has been a very inconsistent hitter (in terms of BA),\nhitting in 1989 - 92  .217, .273, .250, .272    Admittedly, he has\nbeen traded between leagues as well as clubs.  His clutch hitting \nrecord is equally inconsistent.  So, for my purposes in 1993 I would\nnot draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based\non his prior performance.  I don't know how I would have felt in 1988,\nbut you may indeed be right.  \n\nWhen I looked at Sabo I found a more consistent record of hitting, and\na more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately\nbelow his non-clutch BA.  Ditto for Joe Carter.\n\nThis probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement I am having\nwith others on this topic.  Must any conclusion based on statistical\nhistory be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before\nit has any validity?  Is it impossible (or irrational) to apply\nstatistical analysis to selected components of the data base?\n\n\n\nI completely accept that reasoning.  Again, what if we were to find\nthe same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent\nbasis? \n\namen.\n\n\n\n--\tThe Beastmaster\n\n", "\nThe French Canadian rule was an extremely short term feature when the\nuniversal draft was instituted in the sixties and only lasted for a\nfew years...and really didn't have any substantial effect during that\nperiod.  The Canadiens Stanley Cup achievements were earned on a\nlevel playing field.", '\nBetween Adam and Eve and Golgotha the whole process of the fall of man\noccurred.  This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual\nworld.  This is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through\nhistory.  The Greek, for example, could say, "better a beggar in the land\nof the living than a king in the land of the dead." (Iliad, I think).\n\nThe question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is\nan ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to conscign Adam\nor Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.  Yet they all died in their\nsins, in the Christian sense.  The same can be said of the whole of  Gentile\nhumanity, and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to\nhim.  I do not limit the power of Christ to save even him, through whom\nSatan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment.\n\n\nIt is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The\nrelationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely\nextended conditions of Greenwich mean time. It is possible to imagine\nan eternity of agony or bliss - or even many of them - in the\nspiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth.\n\nIt was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous\nwere lost. This again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness\nthat fled from us after the fall, with our ever increasing involvement with\nthe sense world.\n\nIt would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient\npeople\'s ideas of life after death.\n\n\nMankind fell into mist and darkness, and at "the turning point of\ntime" a new light entered into the world.  The light still grows, and\nwe are developing the eyes with which to see by it.  Much new\nrevelation and growth in under- standing lies before us.  Our new\nvision and understanding is still very feeble, but it contains\nsomething new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and\nmuch more as well.\n\n(At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of Rudolf\nSteiner, founder of Anthroposophy, for  many insights that have led me to my\nviews on this subject).\n\n\nThe way you refer to it as "doctrine" puts a modern intellectual coloring\non it. I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually\nconcrete, a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or\nteachings today can be received.\n\nI am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to\nsimple dispersion from an original source.  Even if they were passed\non, the question is, to what extent did they reflect real perception\nand experience?  The similarity in the midst of great variety of\nexpression of the different people\'s ideas of the time immediately\nafter death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.  In\nany case, we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of Euclid,\nbut by contemplating the principles themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity\nthat originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that the\nhuman being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul is\ncreated at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideas\ndominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does\ntoday. He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same\ntime lived during that darkened time when the perception of our\neternal spiritual being had grown dim.\n\n\nIndeed. I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal\nirrevocable damnation is a real possibility.  But the narrow range in\nwhich we conceive of the decisive moment, i.e. after the end of a\nsingle earthly life, is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the\nreality, and I think that is why the early creeds were couched in\nterms that did not try to spell it out.\n', 'A friend of mine is in the market for a 486 system   \n\n\tShould have: 8 M of RAM\n\t\t     170+ M HD\n\t\t     SVGA Monitor and Card \n\t\t     5 1/4 &  3 1/2 FD"s\n\t\t     200+W PS\n\nIf you have one for sale then email me and I will forward to him.\n\nThanks,', "I give up.

(Due to the prevailing assumption \nthat the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)\n\n  The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the \ndevelopment of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications \nof BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!\n\n  REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!\n\n  \n1\n  I dream like this: ether based reality\n \n  The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations \nstart as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices\nboth drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, \nconverting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. \n(non-spinning lattice = "dark matter")\n\n  The earth isn\'t exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image \nof a galaxy; we haven\'t any videos of them spinning. Picture us \nbeing stationary, and the sun\'s image being dragged across the sky by \nthe spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is \nspinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner \nkernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a \nfaster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground \nof the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but \nits "foot print" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])\n  \n  The moon isn\'t exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self \nspin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth\'s ether field, which is \nitself in the sun\'s much more powerful field. Our seasons are the \nwobble of earth\'s axis, like a top slowing down. The "orbit" of the\nearth around the sun is all of the stars\' images being dragged around\nby the sun\'s ether feild.\n\n  The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and "distance" \napart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because \nthe "path" is not the same. The moon\'s lattice in the ether is like \nsticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half \nturn. The sun\'s lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has \ngot the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to \nthe moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a "j" hook at \nthe end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the \nwhole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there. \n\n  With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon \ncan be about as big as "earth\'s" shadow upon it, and at other times \ntotally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, \nwould you guess that they are about the same size, just because they \nlook about the same size?\n\n   O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S\n E       /     \\            \n    M    |      |      OR                M    \n         \\ _ _ /                         \n       S                           \n       \n  The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate\nof ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating "turntable view" \nof the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I\'ve seen a \nhalf moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the \nday. Try and draw that "earth shadow.") Its only the moon\'s image \nwhich appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is \nthe part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away \nfrom the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.\n\n  "Light-Years" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is \ncloser to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase \nof reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. \n(defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be \nessentially happening now. The "piece" of light may have experienced \nmany years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.\n\n  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to \nde-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design \na propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like \ntrying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)\n\n  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I\'d \nlook in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just \nmight carry decipherable data. I\'d start looking on some part of the \nspectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ \nbillion humans?) I\'d totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG \nbackwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card \nfor Pentium!)\n\n  Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound \nmedia, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I \nwould try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which \nI\'d start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. \n[Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a \ntwo foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I \ncould get with my machine\'s receiver next to it.  \n\n  If you don\'t think you\'ll live to see it, consider this: QUIT \nPUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of \nlife\'s data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our \nthoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By \neating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant \ninstructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or \nbiblical guys did live hundreds of years. I\'m curios to see what \nthey did and ate. Don\'t worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we \ndon\'t need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and \nthat is creating matter!

The dark one was in the process of making the \nothers into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by \n"advising" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into \nreproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that \nthe little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to \nprovide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it \nin his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his \ncontrol. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying \nthat there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve \nsouls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was \nfinite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in \nour reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it \nseemed odd, but we couldn\'t remember how else it should be. Then \nsome of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no \nmore, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped \nthrough his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that \nhe had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, \nexisting only on the wind. \n\n  MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls \nwhose will\'s are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat \nothers as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a \nlonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for \nplaymates. (its not eternal, there\'s more than one way back) \n\n Accepting rides to the past:\nOnce here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a \nPrince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go \nahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. \nI Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes \nyour work, but thinks you\'re getting wise, he can direct you to cross \npaths with your old self, and you\'ll vanish as you rewrite your own \ncourse of history, none the wiser.\n\n  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped \nback in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still \nmake changes while he\'s here, its just that that is work, and with \nevery \'adjustment\', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which \nloosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. \nBut he can\'t see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had \nto apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand \nto retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers. \n\n  How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country, \nour money, and they\'re spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this: \nWashington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to \ncongress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks \nare making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big \ncorporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the \nbanks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but \nmostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14 \nhours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time \nto buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If \nwe are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if \nthe point is just to keep the people busy making widgets? \n\n  In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, "its chaos!" They \nsaid, "no, its order." He defined chaos as that which is he was not \nable to control.\n\n  Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy \nwould hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no \nlanguage. (telepathic; and \'vanishing\' the closest knowledge of death)\n(think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and \npointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably \nnaive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should \nbe able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. \nThey can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers \nmight have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a \ndifferent frequency than us as they aren\'t eating seeds.\n\n  Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a \nhuge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat \nonly fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and \nneed a lot less sleep.\n\n  UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The \ntroops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill \neach other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)\n\n  Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot \ntall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they \nsuck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that \nthey aren\'t dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life. \n\n  Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women \nand children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut \nfrom the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think \nthat there may be some very interesting results to this, such as \nmother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants.

All it means to him is that you\'re willing to \nlive on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was \nright, and he didn\'t over play his hand, and he won\'t need to go \nback and try another thread of time.

But again it will not increase the speed\nof your math fuctions.  I think that it will continue to run at 25MHz even\nif your original processor runs at a slower speed.\nThere is also 3) the Kingston 486/NOW platform for $750 with a 33MHz i486DX\non it.  This might speed up your math functions as well, but I am not sure.\n\nIf you have a PS/2 Model 70 B21 or other PS/2 machine with either an i486SX\nor a non-clock doubling i486DX (ie. it runs at either 25 or 33MHz) in it,\nthen you can get an Intel Overdrive chip (which is really an i486DX2 chip) and\nreplace your chip with it.  You should get about 95% better preformance for\nboth normal and math functions.  The 25/50 Mhz version of the Overdrive chip\ncosts $450 and the 33/66MHz version costs $700.  The replacement for the\n25MHz 486SX chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math\ncoprocessor which the 486SX does not have.  Note that the speed ratings on the\nOverdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run.  If you have a\n20MHz 486SX, then the Overdrive chip will run at 20/40MHz, ie. 20MHz externally\nand 40MHz internally.  There is no reason to buy an Overdrive chip which is\nrated at faster then your machine, you will not get faster performance.\n\nYou should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that\nadvertise at the back of PC Magazine or PC Week.

In the state which not so long ago had four\nwomen out of seven representatives, this represents a problem.  The official\nsolution was to change the translation, so now it means:\n\n    "Strong deeds, gentle words"\n\nMy personal suggestion was changing it to "walk softly and carry a big\nstick."', '\n      Two institutions with absolute power.

If the Monarch tried to\ndo something, what would happen?\n  \n\n       But you illustrated the problem very well.\n\n\n       I am contending that there is no state in the Union which does\nnot have ample wealth, if they choose to spend it, to run a perfectly\nacceptable Education system.  (I further contend that the amount of money\nbeing spent now is more then sufficient, but is being spent badly.)\n\n\n       So, tell me Phill.  Were the Republicans also responsible for some\nof the *huge* increases in social programs?  Or were they *only* \nresponsible for what you don\'t like.  (I contend it is Congress which\nis to blame.  Democrat and Republican alike.)\n\n\n       Most of our worst areas are still better off than most of Europe.\nIn any case, we\'re talking about *education*.  \n\n\n       Yes, I live in once such area.  You\'re woefully ignorant of the\nsituation.\n\n       At the same time some of Tennessee\'s school districts are closing\ndown, the Governor asked for 7.5 million dollars for bicentenntial\ncelebration license plats.  In almost the same breath he wanted to raise\nunemployment compensation and reduce taxes which paid into it.\n \n       I don\'t know about the rest of the country, but *our* education\nproblems stem directly from two problems, neither of which are a lack\nof money in the state.  (BTW, Tennessee is considered a "tax heaven"\nand our economy is one of the strongest in the country.  *I* see\na correlation.)  1)  What money we spend goes primarly to administration.\nThe average administrator makes two and a half times what the average\nteacher makes, and sucks up an enormous amount of revenue.  And 2)\nthe Governor is making a concerted effort to create an "Education crisis"\nin order to push for his pet income tax.  Some of the most idiotic\nprograms get funded (like State funds for new art in the county seat)\nwhile schools are closing.  It\'s not a lack of funds.  It\'s an\nunwillingness to spend them on what is more appropriate.  Education\nis *the* parental hot-button.  Education is *always* the first to\nbut cut, because it\'s easier to get people to pay for their children\nthan ugly art.\n\n\n      It spoke very eloquently on government being based on the\nconsent of the governed.  \n\n\n      They did it anyway.  The Continental Congress had its own set of\nbylaws.  It wasn\'t quite a government, but a means of making decisions\nhad to be created.  (However low George Washington\'s opinion of them were.)\n\n\n      Allow me again to speak heresy against the Holy Democratic Orders.\nSo what?  The government was built with a very non-democratic Presidency\nwith fairly broad powers, including the veto.\n\n\n      Yes, and the Senate was intended to act as a balance to this.\nToo much democracy was intentionally avoided.  It was considered a good\nthing to place non-democratic blocks to impulsive action.\n\n\n      So long as Congress has something to sell, people will pay for\nit.  Most congressmen rake in more money than they need.\n\n\n       No, if the "progressives" don\'t want the "reactionaries" to move\nbackward, they get the same benefit.  41% of the states is a *lot* of\npeople.  And historically laws with that sort of minority arent\'\nvery effective, especially since it is usually geographically\nconcentrated.\n       When wielding the Federal Big Stick I don\'t see why they shouldn\'t\nhave to make a better argument than, "more people than not," agree.\n       \n\n       I\'m not a Republican.  I\'m a republican.  :-)\n       \n       And no, I\'m neither a Democrat nor a democrat.\n       \n       Now, I\'ve asked several times, and all you\'ve done is answer\n"It isn\'t democratic," which I knew before I said it.  Why *should*\nit be democratic?  We don\'t have a true direct democracy, and few\npeople advocate one.  Why, then, is this other modification of\ndemocracy to bias it against action so much worse?\n', 'Went to the Dodgers game tonight -- it was cap night.\n \nAstacio pitched ok, but had control trouble all night.\nIn the first, he walked a batter, balked him to second, then\na single scored the run, with the batter taking second on the\nthrow home.  Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.\n \nLasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza\nbatting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder\nand Webster.\n \nPiazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards.\nThe Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single\nby Offerman.\n \nBy the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but\nthe score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive\nplays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner\ntrying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who\nhad strayed a bit from first base, etc.\n \nKarros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into\nthe outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going\nthrough, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw\nto third and EASILY got the runner at third.\n \nMy heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.\n \nAstacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game\nwith the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.\n \nGross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3\ninnings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning\ngame had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh\ngiven his light work out Tuesday.\n \nGross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit\nto the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted\nin a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it\n3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next\nthing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on\nfirst was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had\nscored long before that.\n \nMeanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning.\nLee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros\nand Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?).\nCory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but\nthat was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his\nthird straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my\nfree Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this\nup all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year\nhonors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs\nof a sophomore jinx year.\n \nThe final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits.\nDodgers 2 runs on 7 hits.', "\n\n\n\n\n\t1.

As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied\nand annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.\n\nSome 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly\ndeported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland.\nTogether with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also\nbeen driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan.\nSome 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives \nof other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central\nAsia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee\nthem the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.\n\nOne of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against\nAzerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the\nArmenian extremists\' destruction of the Karabakh scientific\nexperimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection \nof the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.\n\nWe beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance,\nfor the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are\nviolated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled,\nits people are shot. There is persistent negative image of\nAzerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over \nthe whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the\nUSSR and the United States. \n\nOne of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and\ngenerated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance\nwhile the truth is that all these shootings and recent \nevents stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on\nAzerbaijan.\n\nIt is a well documented fact that before the conflict there\nwere no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the\nissue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly\nand calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their\nrepresentatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan\nSSR.\n\nWe are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we \nare for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one\nof the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic \nRepublic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.\n\nBut all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the\nSoviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists\nencouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new \'1,000\nYear Reich\' - the \'Great Armenia\' - by annexing the \nneighboring lands.\n\nThe world public opinion shed tears to save the whales,\nsuffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.\n\nBut what about the lives of seven million human beings?\nIf these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are\nless valuable? Can people be discriminated by their \ncolour of skin or religion, by their residence or other\nattributes?\n\nAll people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers\nfor help and understanding. This is not the first appeal\nof Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous\nappeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope\nthat the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda\nwill one day reveal the extent of our suffering and\nstimulate at least as much help and compassion for\nAzerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.\n\n\t\tTHE COMMITTEE FOR PEOPLE\'S HELP TO \n                KARABAKH (OF THE) ACADEMY OF SCIENCES \n                OF THE AZERBAIJAN SSR\n\n\n"PAINFUL SEARCH .."\n\nTHE GRUESOME extent of February\'s killings of Azeris by Armenians\nin the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about\n600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the\nfour-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.\n\nThe figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials\nand casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid\nworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.\n\nThe 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of\nthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control\nof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations\nin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting\nretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the\ndead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first\nsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.\nLater  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken\nAzerbaijan\'s wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000\ndead.\n\nThe State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a\n15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  "Hojali\nDisaster", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on\npreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman\nMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in\nthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more\nthan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\n\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. "We  did  not count  the\nbodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy," Mr\nZen Ruffinen said. "We have some idea since we gave the body bags\nand products to wash the dead."\n\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. "Don\'t  get worked up.  It will\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure," the  43-year-old\nlawyer said at his small office.\n\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\n\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\n\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\nrepublic\'s forensic department. "This  is just a small percentage\nof the dead," said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic\'s chief forensic\nscientist. "They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\nour dead within 24 hours."\n\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov\'s\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\n\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov\'s  investigative  commission  are  still\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The\nmost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far\ncomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a\nhelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27\nFebruary.\n\n"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to\ncount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream\nand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village," Mr\nManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter\npilot.\n\n"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and\none  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was\npulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but\nArmenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to\nreturn."\n\nThere  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in\ncirculation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few\nmonths and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali\nat the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages\ntaken over by Armenian forces.\n\nTHE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/\'92\n\n\nHEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES\n\nAREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the\nCaspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in\nhis trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of\nHojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.\n\n"I\'m still  wearing the same  clothes, I don\'t have  any others,"\nthe  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the\nHojali disaster. "I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to\nbe alive."\n\nMr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity\nfor more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12\ndays. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the\n2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the\nedge of Karabakh.\n\n"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard\nbefore,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy\nmachine-guns, the lot," Mr Sadikov said.\n\nSoon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction\nof  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started\nfleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the\nsnow into a forest on the other side.\n\nTo escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam\nabout 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it,\nuntil at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two\nArmenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.\n\n"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by\na  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening\nfire," Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAzeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward\nto force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts\nwere mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his\ngroup of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman\nson.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his\n67-year-old elder brother.\n\n"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,"\nhe said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. "We\nhave never got any of the bodies back."\n\nThe first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.\nOne hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he\nstruggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group\'s\ncrossing, Mr Sadikov said.\n\nAnother hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and\nseveral others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy\nhillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three\nArmenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.\n\nAs the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was\nlittle comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was\nsoon to flee.\n\n"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian\nrocket attack. Some people just  kept going," Mr Sadikov said. "I\nhad to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way.\nThey even found a bullet in my sock."\n\nVictims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the\nHojali massacre in February  (left).

First, let me\nflame the famous Dave S. : He\'s obviously only 10 years old.  Cut him\nsome slack. :^}\n\nThe joke about Clinton/crypto/drugs slammed me thru the roof.  Nice job\nguys!  I\'ve been working on marijuana legalization for over 5 years\nnow, Clinton\'s actions so far have really helped.  But because of\ngovernment action taken against various other groups, I have developed\na 64 bit DES based on public literature to protect my mailing list.\nThe S-boxes are the critical component, and since I chose 32 out of 57\nbased on the key, cracking this DES is going to tough.  (The reason it\nslows you down a touch is that for each key you try you need to use a\ndifferent set of s-boxes, I know it\'s only a vector, but it sure makes\nrandom search a pain).  Several marijuana legalization groups have had\ntheir mailing lists confiscated when people were charged with drug\nuse/sales.  It\'s not a crime to be a member of a legalization org,\n*but* you will be watched.\n\nIt really is important to write a letter to every official you\npersonally vote for to explain *why* your privacy is being destroyed by\nthe "cripple chip".  Amazingly enough they do listen when they get\n*enough* mail.  The Doonsbery jokes about NRA postcards are real, and\nthe IMI (Illinois Marijuana Initiative) has grown to the point where we\n*are* seeing some changes.\n\nIt\'s pretty clear that all the hullabaloo is really about the\nimplimentation decision being made behind our backs.  As Vesselin\npoints out, this was common practice in communist regimes (and may be\nagain depending on how the vote goes).  But just as criminals have guns\nand "law abiding" citizens don\'t, and criminals like me have marijuana\nand "law abiding" subjects don\'t, criminals like me will have secure\ncrypto while "law abiding" robots don\'t.  PGP is nice, but as time goes\non we all can do better.  And to save our hides we will.\n\nSomeone posted an excerpt from Machiavelli.  He\'s my favorite dude.\n500 years ago he saw clearly how people *are*, and tried to explain\nthat to "princes" who wanted people to *obey*.  One section not quoted\n(I\'ve got "The Prince" at home, so I\'ll just paraphrase :) ) had to do\nwith conquring a free city.  The only way is to *completly destroy*\nit.  Failing that, you must appoint locals to high positions and accept\nthe people\'s customs.  Even after 100 years of oppression, a people\nwill remember their heratige and rise up to overthrow the oppresive\ngovernment.  And he gave an example.  And that was 300 years *before*\nThomas Jefferson.\n\nThere were questions about watching traffic.  Only *interesting* traffic\nis watched: stuff that goes overseas and comes back; stuff with keywords\nlike marijauana, cryptography, NSA;  certain individuals who are known\nsubversives, etc.  It is easy enough to store all that traffic.  So if\nyou know how to be *subversive* i.e. how to be unseen, it\'s pretty easy\nto go unnoticed for a long time.  The stronger your crypto system and the\nless you\'re noticed, the better your chances of developing an organization\nwhich can diseminate truth to the masses.\n\nWhich gets me to the thread about a "public encrypted conference".\nThat\'s just silly.  The first thing the feds do is send in an\ninfiltrator (like Dave S.) and they know what you\'re doing.  It will be\nfun for teenagers and college students, but for the real world it\'s\npretty pointless.  Crypto is useful for more things than hiding where\nyou get your marijuana.\n\nGuns, drugs and crypto do have some commonality: there are people in\ngovernment who want you to *obey* their rules.  As Lundquist says in\nalt.drugs "Live free or don\'t".  Machiavelli pointed out that\'s just\nhow most people actually live, inspite of appearences to the contrary.\nIt\'s true that the decision to shove the clipper (not the same thing as\nIntergraph\'s!!!) down our throats violates the principles of what the\nU.S. was founded on, but the government is full of idiotic robots\ncalled bureaucrats and there\'s less to worry about than one might\nthink.  Only really innocent (read naive) subjects of the U.S. will be\nhurt by this, the rest of us *criminals* will live in secure freedom.\nde Toqueville pointed out 150+ years ago that the tyranny of the\nmajority will be mitigated by the mediocrity of the government.\n\nAnd given what I see government officials doing where I work (Argonne\nNational Lab.) the level of stupidity makes Dave S. look smart.\n\nPatience, persistence, truth,\t\twork: dvader@hemp-imi.hep.anl.gov\nDr. mike\t\t\t\thome: mrosing@igc.org\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: 2.2', '====================================================\n       H    H      A      RRRRR    RRRRR   IIIII  SSSS\n       H    H     A A     R    R   R    R    I   S    \n       HHHHHH    AAAAA    RRRRR    RRRRR     I    SSSS\n       H    H   A     A   R    R   R    R    I        S \n       H    H  A       A  R     R  R     R IIIII  SSSS  \n     ====================================================\n\n\nHarris Semiconductor now has AnswerFAX.

I\nwas told that if I were ever attacked by a dog I should ball my hand in a fist and\nforce it down the dog's throat. The dog would naturally gag and release, and become\nmomentarily disoriented. This commonly happens to humans when we go to a doctor and\nhave our throats examined ( Proof Positive ). In the time during the dog's\ndisorientation, the next move would be to wrap an arm about the dog throat in a \nchoke hold manner and constrict with all your might until the dog lapses into\nunconsciousness ( from lack of oxygen and halting blood flow ). Finally, run like\nthe wind to get away from the local area should the dog get up again and be really\npissed.\n\nOOOOOOOpsssss.

The directive provides for the following:\n\nAdvanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption\nare part of a wave of new computer and communications technology. \nEncryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of\ncommunications and data by preventing unauthorized access. \nAdvanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to\nrapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications. \nThese advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the\ninfrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the\ninformation age.\n\nDespite its benefits, new communications technology can also\nfrustrate lawful government electronic surveillance.  Sophisticated\nencryption can have this effect in the United States.  When\nexported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence\nactivities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has\nbeen possible to preserve a government capability to conduct\nelectronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law\nenforcement and national security interests, while at the same time\nprotecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As\nencryption technology improves, doing so will require new,\ninnovative approaches.\n\nIn the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has\ndeveloped a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through\nencryption that is substantially more robust than the current\ngovernment standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed\nto unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys\nwill allow the government to gain access to encrypted information\nonly with appropriate legal authorization.\n\nTo assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect\nand decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted\ninformation, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:\n\nINSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS\n\nThe Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,\nshall request manufacturers of communications hardware which\nincorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed\nkey-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law\nenforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from\nthe American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to\nensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow\nmicrocircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications\nhardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the\nsecurity of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do\nnot intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the\ngovernment from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that\nare equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-\nescrow system.\n\nKEY-ESCROW\n\nThe Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate\nentities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits\ninstalled in communications equipment.  In each case, the key\nholder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent\nunauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only\nto government agencies that have established their authority to\nacquire the content of those communications that have been\nencrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney\nGeneral shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which\nan agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such\ncommunications.\n\nPROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES\n\nThe Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate\nU.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to\nfacilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted\nwith key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems\nthat process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this\nprocess to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of\na final standard within six months of this directive.

A\nfairly simple problem, given our size and numbers.  Do you agree?  We\nall believe criminals, particularly violent criminals, should not have\nfirearms.  The problem is making a law that does this without trodding\nupon the rights of the vast majority.  Nobody here seems to be able to\ndo it, and I doubt anybody in Norway can either.  Thus, we are left with\na philosophical difference: does the safety of a few justify restricting\nthe many?  We say "no," while others say "yes."\n\n\n\tCan you provide a method that cannot be abused?  I doubt it.\n\n\n\tOf course.  This is not in contention.  What is in contention\nis how much one has to pay.\n\n\n\tIt is this "giving a little" that makes Americans wary...\nWe have seen this argument before.  You might remember how a\nChamberlain "gave a little" to a particular fascist/short asshole,\nand how such "appeasement" worked.  While it might work in some\ninstances, it doesn\'t work in others, and since we cannot predict\nthe future we must be cautious in using actions that have a\nhistory of failure.\n\n\n\tCars are not essential in Norway any more than they are in\nthe USA.  I\'m willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be\nwilling to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price.  Thus,\ncars are not essential for your transportation.  However, the\narguments presented show that, since cars are used to kill far more\npeople than guns in the USA, it makes much more sense to restrict\ncars than it does guns.  How one defines "essential" often depends\nupon what one is willing to go through for that service.  When we\nlook at the raw data, such comparisons are not individually weighed.\n\n\n\tThis depends upon what the populace was willing to do.  As\nDesert Storm proved, even an armed populace won\'t just revolt even\nwhen given a chance.  Still, would Hitler have done all that he did\nwith an armed populace?  We have to wonder, as some of his first\nacts were to confiscate firearms.  Other points in history show\nthat dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace.\nThus, we\'re left wondering if Hitler would have been overthrown\nor if King George was just unlucky in keeping the USA as a colony.\nOne can argue both sides; one also has to live with each action.\n\n\n\tIt is about #2, but so far all proposals to curtail #2 have\nwound up enforcing #1 as well.

What you described SOUNDS the same to me.  In fact, what little\n& i\'ve studied on trannies, the instructor referred to the synchros as "dogs"\n& and said they were synonymous.  The gears are always meshed in a synchronized\n& gearbox, and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting. Or at least,\n& that is what i was taught.  Explain, por favour?\n\nMotorcycle transmissions don\'t have synchros.  The engagment dogs are very\ncorse and sloppy.  There are maybe 6-10 teeth (dogs) on the side of the\ngears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears back\nand forth.  To shift:  start to apply pressure at the same time the\nclutch is pulled (the clutch is a hand lever) and shift quickly.  If \nyou try a slow lazy shift it will grind, you just have to pop it into\nthe next gear before it has a chance to grind.  There isn\'t a neutral\nbetween gears (obviously there is, but you can\'t select it with the\nshifter) so double clutching is not a possibility.  "speed shifting"\n(which is what I have always heard "clutchless shifting" called) works\npretty well for upshifts with some practice, but I usually use the\nclutch-especially for the lower gears.\n\nI think auto (as in automobile) trannys are similar, except that the\nengagment dogs are very fine, with no slop.  And the addition of\nsyncho rings.  The gear teeth are always engaged in auto transmissions\nthat are synchronized, but may not be in non-synchro gears (reverse\nand sometimes first).  \n', '(Please note followup)\nIn <1993Apr27.012045.8543@Virginia.EDU> ab4z@Virginia.EDU ("Andi\n\n\nComparing Israel to Nazi Germany is name-calling of the lowest kind.\nPlease don\'t be disingenuous.\n\n\nDo civil libertarians make no distinction between the Nazis and\nIsrael?

It has\n\tcertainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in\n\tspite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.\n\tThat it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is\n\t"infectious" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides\n\ta workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this\n\tis the case).\n\n\tI disagree that Christianity is "a safety blanket" which supplants\n\thope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one\n\tSource of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a\n\tChristian\'s source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to\n\tyou is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose\n\tand externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of\n\tcontrol over one\'s own life the problem or is it something else?\n\n\tFinally, one does not appropriate "eternal happiness" by following\n\tChristian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance\n\tof Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people\n\tfrom their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the\n\tChristian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian\n\tin the Person of God\'s Spirit.\n\n\tHeaven is one of two final states that\n\tChristian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally\n\tnot motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this\n\tpromised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived\n\tbenefits to them in the here-and-now.\n\n\n\tMany Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a\n\tpriority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this\n\tas a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate\n\tpriority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,\n\tconvert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).\n\tRather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting\n\tthe opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits\n\tof a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful\n\tthat it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask\n\t"Why?"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-\n\tplished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it\n\tdoes not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian\n\tis required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of\n\tfriendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot\n\tevaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or\n\tharm others if the sole purpose of being a "friend" is to gain a\n\tconversion).\n\n\tAs a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-\n\tticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a "hurry-up"\n\tattitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no\n\tconversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was\n\tcoerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open\n\tto it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).\n\tThe Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings\n\tconviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part\n\t(witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.\n\n\n\tWe are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die\n\tjust as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more\n\tthan this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is\n\tso limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find\n\ta more expansive view.\n\n\t(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing\n\tarts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language\n\tof other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?\n\tHow is it that humans can organize themselves in various social\n\tstructures whereas other animals have only one structure?)\n\n\n\tBlatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive.\n\tChristianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not\n\ta *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship\n\twith a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close-\n\tknit relationship with this appelation.\n\n\n\tThere are "Jesus freaks" who let the emotional aspects of worship\n\tand Christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand.  Even so,\n\tthis does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these\n\tthings flow.\n\n\n\tGuilty by association?  That "christianity" which forces itself\n\tupon another is not Christianity at all.\n\n\n\tYou appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened\n\t2000 years ago.  How did you come by it?\n\n\tI cannot accept your conclusion that Jesus\' influence was a sole\n\tresult of the Roman sack of Jerusalem in 70AD.  He was 30+ years\n\tgone by this time.  It strains the bounds of credulity to assert\n\tthat nothing about Jesus\' life was noteworthy _until_ the sack.\n\n\n\tChristianity is having a relationship with Jesus Christ Himself.\n\tWhat do you know of Him?\n', 'The vote to create the proposed group, Sci.life-extension, was\naffirmative.\n\nYes votes:    237.\nNo votes:      28.\n\nWhat follows is a list of the people who voted, by vote ("no" or "yes").\n\nHere are the people who voted NO:\n\nbailey@utpapa.ph.utexas.edu               (Ed Bailey)\nbarkdoll@lepomis.psych.upenn.edu          (Edwin Barkdoll)\nmsb@sq.com                                (Mark Brader)\ncarr@acsu.buffalo.edu                     (Dave Carr)\ndesj@ccr-p.ida.org                        (David desJardins)\njbh@Anat.UMSMed.Edu                       (James B.

Should we be crossposting this to misc.legal?', 'By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff\n\nAt 9:11 Thursday night, the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer.\nTheir cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of\n17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to\nthe playoff-bound Blues.\n\nThe scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3.\nWith the North Stars\' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the\nfinal playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit\nplaying.\n\nThey held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared\nwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep\nand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.\nTampa\'s Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating\nsupervisor John D\'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the\nshot had gone into the net after time had expired.\n\n``I\'m glad I didn\'t see it go in at the end," Blues coach Bob Berry said.\n\nIf the goal had counted, he\'d have been more upset than he was by the Blues\'\ndisappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making\nthe playoffs tempered Berry\'s anger.\n\n``It wasn\'t pretty at the end," he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as\ngood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn\'t have, but\nit did."\n\nStill, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game\'s end.\nDespite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this\nseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They\'ll meet the Chicago Blackhawks\nin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at\nChicago Stadium.\n\nThe Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,\ntheir fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points\nbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,\nwhich played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its\nfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.\n\nThe poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous\nBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.\n\n``It\'s a shame we let down," said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score\ntwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.\n``There was no need for a letdown. If we\'d have kept working, it would have\nended 6-2 and everyone would be happy."\n\nInstead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.\n``We won, and that\'s all that matters," said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3\nfor the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play."\n\nSome players didn\'t have a problem.\n\n``Just because the score was announced, our line didn\'t quit," said Rich\nSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You\ncan\'t allow five goals like we did, that\'s not right.\n\n``It was disappointing to see what was going on."\n\nBassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues\' effort. Somehow,\nhe missed the announcement of Minnesota\'s loss.\n\n``I didn\'t know it was final," he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the\nbench. I didn\'t realize it was a final for some reason. We\'re in the playoffs,\nand that\'s great, but it\'s a little disappointing to play like we did at the\nend."\n\nThe letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard\noperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score\nshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third\nperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.\n\n``I told them I didn\'t want to see the score, I didn\'t want to know the score,"\nBerry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that\'s the approach we took."\n\nIf Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might\nbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.\n\nUntil the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd\ngoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,\nMiller and Bassen took charge late in the period.\n\nWith the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked\ndefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the\nrebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.\n\nThen, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski\nafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.\n\nBassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the \nrebound of Bret Hedican\'s shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of\nthe season and reminded him of a special friend.\n\nLast year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form\nof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.\n\n``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver," Bassen said. ``He\'s in heaven now, and\nI know he was watching. I know he\'s happy."\n\nMiller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo\nat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph\'s shutout just 18 seconds\nlater, making it 5-1.\n\nLess than a minute after the North Stars\' final was announced, Tim Bergland\nscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass\nfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.\n\nThen, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third\nperiod, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals\nto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third\nperiod.\n\nThe goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan\'s second goal stand up as the\nwinner. ``We were in there," Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in."', '\nI became aware of the claim years ago.  So I decided to check it out, on my\nown.  But, then, that was in BN times (Before Net).  So, here are some \nreferences.  See Robin Lane Fox\'s _The unauthorized version_, (p.284) where \nLane Fox writes, "... the one passage which appears to [comment on Jesus\' \ncareer] is agreed to be a Christian addition."\n\nIn my Re:Albert Sabin response (C5u7sJ.391@sunfish.usd.edu) to Jim Lippard (21\nApril 93), I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine \nPagel\'s _The gnostic gospels_ (p.85), to wit:  "A comment *attributed* to\nJosephus reports ... [emphasis mine]".  Scholars sometimes do not even mention\nthe two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.\n\nSo far as I can deduce, today\'s consensus is built on at least three things: \n1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about the\nlong passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory. \nI don\'t know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are\norginally developed (does anyone?).\n\nBiblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.  The\nformer, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological and\nideological contexts as well as theology.  So the distinction is blurred.  I \ndidn\'t elaborate on that.  Sorry.  (In turn, historians are compelled to\nincorporate theology).\n\nCan\'t say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before \nGutenburg).  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one \nhand seems more reasonable.  Perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any,\nbecause anything is possible) have been destroyed.  Such a practice is \ncertainly not foreign to religions.  Anyway, all we have are mss. which have \nthe two entries.  Lippart (in the message noted above) talks about an Arabic \nms.  But here the ms. date is critical.\n\n:-)', ": I think Dean got hit by a pitched ball the other night... he got pinch hit for\n: and didn't play against Baltimore tonight... whats up with that?

They took X-rays\nof the arm and there is nothing damaged.  He missed the last game with the\nOrioles, but he is suppose to be ready for the next game.\n\nHope this helps.", '\nThe basic definition that I use is:\n\tThe belief that Jesus was God incarnate.\n\tThe belief that Jesus was crucified and raised from the dead\n\tfor our salvation.\n\tThe acceptance of Jesus as personal Lord and Savior.\n\nThis would include most Christian denominations, but exclude the Unitarians.\n\t', '\n\n\nIt seemed pretty conclusive to me.  The puck clearly hit the crossbar\nand then came down on the line.  And the announcers, admittedly homers,\nkept harping about how they "must have had a different view upstairs"\nbecause it was obvious to them, and, I would have thought, to anyone who\nsaw the replay, that the puck didn\'t go in.  The referee originally \nsignalled no goal but the video replay "judges" initiated contact with\nthe referee to claim that a goal was in fact scored.  This, to me, is\nunheard of.

Maybe 3-4 times for each except for the 2YO girl, who has\nnot been spanked yet.\n     They call it that because it *does* hurt their feelings, and of course\nI give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know they\'re still loved.\n\n     No, that would be too painful.  If it\'s too traumatic they never recall\nwhy they were punished.  Besides, it must be immediate, and taking the time\nto go get a toolmeans you\'re not doing it right away, and that lessens the\nimpact.  It\'s very emotional for a child as it is - which is evidenced by the\nfact that a little slap on the rear - which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds -\nis called a spanking.\n     Lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4YO Matthew dared\na good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, I made\nsure they didn\'t play together for 5 days so he\'d know that would make him\nlose friends very quickly.  He\'s never done anything like that since.\n     We also use time-out in their rooms - I use a timer so they don\'t keep\narguing with me over leaving, since it\'s hard to argue with a macine.\nI will go to the closed door and tell them timeout won\'t be over until they\ncalm down if they\'re too tantrumy.

Our family and my husband\'s have never\nused spankings.  In fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and they\nwere almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And,\nnone of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or God\'s law.\n     Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that "what\nye do to the least of these, ye do also to me."  The Bible also says in all\nthings to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving. (Colossians 3:12-15.)\nThere is no room for selfish anger, which I\'ll admit I\'ve been tempted with\nat times.  When I\'ve felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved\na little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been the\ndevil\'s work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid\nto his/her room and went to my room myself.  After praying and asking God\'s\nforgiveness, I was much calmer, and did not feel like spanking, but felt that\nwhat I had done was enough punishment.', 'Not that the question is anything important, but I am still curious:\nWhy is that almost all printed circuit boards are green?

If Christianity is a DRUG, and once we die we\ndie, then why would you be reluctant to embrase this drug so that\nwhile you are alive you enjoy yourself.\n\nI also question your overall motives for posting this article.  Why\nwould you waste your presious fews seconds on this earth posting your\nopinon to a group that will generally reject it.\n\nIf you die, never having acepting Christ as your savior, I hope you\nhave a fantastic life that it is all you evver dreamed because it is\nal of heaven you will ever know.', "\nThat's not true.    I gave you two examples.   One was the rather\npevasive anti-semitism in German Christianity well before Hitler\narrived.   The other was the system of social ranks that were used\nin Imperail Germany and Austria to distinguish Jews from the rest \nof the population.\n\nNeither of these were very terrible in themselves, but both helped\nto set a psychology in which the gradual disenfranchisement of Jews\nwas made easier.", 'Joachim Martillo writes\n\nIf you were to substitute the word "Jew"/"Jewish" in this posting where you  \nsee the word "Muslim"/"Islamic", switch Joachim and Mohammed\'s names around,  \nand then repost this, you would get a flood of messages attacking the author  \nas an anti-semite. And rightly so. The author of this crap is a racist, pure  \nand simple. He obviously has no qualms about being open with it, either,  \nunlike some other Arab- and Mulsim-bashers on the Net. \n\nNow, I for one, am not going to look at Joachim\'s posting and infer from it  \nthat all Jews think this way. Sure, there might be some, but this view is not  \na part of Judaism, and it is stupid to believe that all Jews\' minds are this  \ntwisted. However, some Muslims might look at Joachim\'s flame as a  \nreaffirmation of their worst fears about Jews: that they all hate Arabs and  \nare racists.\n\nFor this reason, I am alarmed that not more Jews on the Net have spoken out  \nagainst what Joachim has said. They have the chance to possibly change the  \nanti-semitic views of some people on the net, to show them that all Jews do  \n*not* hate all Arabs and Muslims, just like all Muslims do *not* hate all  \nJews. Yet they are missing that chance.

Any other questions?', ": It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions\n: prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.\n\nA good example of this is Abraham (referred to in the James passage). Hebrews\nsays that Abraham was justified by faith -- but his faith was demonstrated\nthrough his works (i.e., he obeyed what God told him to do).\n\nReading Abraham's ``biography'' in Genesis is very instructive. He was a man\nbeset by *lack* of faith a lot of the time (e.g. lying about Sarah being his\nwife on 2 occasions; trying to fulfil God's promise on God's behalf by\ncopulating with Hagar). . . yet it seems that God didn't evaluate him on the\nbasis of individual incidents. Abraham is listed as one of the ``heroes of \nfaith'' in Hebrews 11. i.e., when it really came to the crunch, God declared\nAbraham as a man of faith. He believed God's promises.\n\nThis gives us confidence. Although real faith demonstrates itself through\nworks, God is not going to judge us according to our success/failure in\nperforming works.\n\n``Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy\nhe saved us, through the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy\nSpirit.''

Rude of you to call Gary Coffman a nobody.  \n\n: "Well, it\'s not the main gun."  Gee, that\'s only the entire point.  Are you\n: now going to admit that you were wrong?\n\nThat was the entire point to *you*.  What exactly did I claim?\n   --------------------------------------------------\n  "I\'ve heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns\nto respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively."\n   --------------------------------------------------\n\n  I wasn\'t wrong . . . I\'ve heard those descriptions.  If you\'re\npaying attention, I\'ve mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own\neyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps\npeople judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,\n"bullshit filters".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.\n\n  What was it I claimed as fact?  Here\'s the entire post:\n  --------------------------------------------------\n\nCorrection.  I know they used tanks in Detroit 1968.  I saw em, it\nwas well covered in the news at that time.  Gordon Lightfoot mentions\nit in his song "Black Day in July".\n  --------------------------------------------------\n\n  Since you don\'t dispute that and claim that nobody else does, that\nmeans I was right.  \n\n: I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the \'67\n: riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place\n: without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American\n: military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have\n: been *big* news.\n\n   So one would suppose.  Some folks think in happened in 48.  \n\nAwesley goes on:\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\n\n: To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\n: grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be\n: perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn\'t you, since\n: it makes your other claim seem more plausible.\n\nJohn, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you\'re losing it so you\nhave to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said\nnothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you\nneed some help, let me know and I\'l take your side of this for a\nwhile.  You\'re not scoring here, you\'re boring here. \n\n: If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been\n: screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about\n: it. \n\n   Glad to know you\'re such an expert.  Nice to hear some an\nauthority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it\nhad happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an\nauthority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged\nmassive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.\nSome claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but\nthe Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was "several".  I\'ve also\nheard some things about that but I won\'t dare repeat them.  You\'d\nassert that I claimed they were truth.\n\n: Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \n\n   Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the \ndifference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 \nyears ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.\nSo it would have been an Army cover-up.\n\n   Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building\nwere burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and\nam inclined to believe an old sarge or two.\n\n: If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer\n: to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\n: those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.\n\n   Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I\'m quite willing to believe\nthat they did fire their guns.\n\n   Now then, we\'ve bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read\nthis far and all you\'ve managed to say is that you don\'t believe the\naccount I cited.\n\n: --John L.

The bibliography for the article cited a\nphilosophical paper (the name and author of which I sadly forget; I\nbelieve the author was Italian) on what constitutes a legal and/or moral\nperson, i.e., a being entitled to the rights normally accorded to a\nperson.

For the first 6 months, the women each day ate\n8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second \n6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the    \nwomen each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection \nwere significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.   \n  The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.  \nIt is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The   \nresearchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some    \nbrands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus         \nthermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used  \nin commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a         \nprotective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to  \ntry yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists     \nacidophilus in its contents.                                            \n--- end ---\n              \n\n                              \n===================================\n\nInfoTrac - Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92\n  THE MATERIAL CONTAINED IN Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92 IS PROVIDED\n  ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS\n  MEDICAL ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION.

In some circumstances, though, the    \norganisms proliferate, producing symptomatic infection of the mouth,    \nintestines, vagina, or skin. When the mouth or vagina are infected, the \ndisease is commonly called thrush.                                      \n  Vaginitis caused by Candida often afflicts women on birth control     \npills or antibiotics.

Treatment can be with amphotericin B or orally with ketoconazole.\nThere is no evidence that Candida in the intestine of normal individuals\nleads to disease. All people at one time or another have Candida in     \ntheir intestines.

Something like this would require more attention by\nthe referee.\n\n\nBut you're creating a scoring opportunity where there might not\nhave been one before.  I can see the relationship between free\nthrows awarded after a certain number of fouls, but it's\nobviously easier to score in basketball, there are more\nopportunities.  If a basketball team scores 100 points, that's\nat least fifty chances made.  The average number of shots taken\nby each team in a hockey game (and this is a total guess) is\nprobably around 40, and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe\n5 of them.  You have some good ideas concerning the other\npenalties, but I think that a player should be awarded a\npenalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was\ninterfered with.\n\nAlso, later in the post, you talked about how boring the NBA\ngame you attended was, that play was stopped too often.\nWouldn't your penalty shot rule take up more time during a\nhockey game?", "\n\nyet.\n\nI'm not bored either.  Most people I know say that winning the second Cup\nwas better than the first but to me nothing will ever top that first one.\nBut I'm every bit as excited this year and I am experiencing that inner calm\nto which Susan originally referred.  Inner calm is not boredom.\n\nAs far as the arena in general being boring, well Richard's got that right.\nIt's been that way all season.  I attribute it to a lot of new fans who\njust don't have the same spirit and knowledge as long-time fans.  At\nlast Tuesday's game, I overheard a man express surprise that a\ngoaltender can get an\nassist.\n\nAnyone who follows sports with regularity knows that anything can happen\nat any time.  I'm confident in the Pens but I'm also not stupid enough to\nthink for one minute that it's impossible for New Jersey to blow them out\nof this series.  I doubt that will happen but it's possible.  Bored?  Uh-uh.\nSpoiled?  Not in the least.  Forgot what excitement is like?  Living through\nthat amazing streak wasn't exciting?!  I don't take a darned thing for\ngranted.  God, look at Chicago...\n\nAnd I see no problem with quietly savoring all of this anyway.  It isn't gonna\nlast forever and I intend to enjoy it while I can.  ", '\n\nThe Bible does tell us that governments are ordained by God (Romans 13).\n And furthermore, God foreknows everything that would happen.  It is\njust to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, the\ninevitablity of the sucess of God\'s plan, and this is especially hard to\ngrasp when we see governemnts doing evil.  However, though they are\ndoing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), it\nmust be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to\nthe final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is\npossible.  In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the\neyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts\nnow rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing\npeople for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and\nAnnias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His\nplan might be accomplished.\n    But don\'t forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to\nexecute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used to\nfulfill the chorus of "Let his blood be upon our hands" of the crowd in\nJersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel,\nwhich was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punish\nother nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament. \nDon\'t you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, "Mene, mene,\ntekel, peres?"  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God\'s\njustice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians\nas their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is the\nextirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel. \nThe Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and\nthe Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could go\non with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is\nquite clear.\nTwo things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to\nquestion why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom,\nHe made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans\n9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message of\nJesus Christ is as follows: "Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at\nhand."  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - "Let\nthe dead bury the dead, come, follow me."  There is not an infinite\namount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to\nfollow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, "well, alright,\nyou can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your\nplans."  He said "Follow me."  His message is NOT "I\'m just a sweety-pie\nwho would never hurt a fly, you\'ve got all the time in the world, and\nDivine Judgement, that\'s only a fairy tale."  "Our great God and Savior"\nJesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the\nworld.  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be\nquestioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.', "\nGood point, Brett.  It might merely be proof that basic health care\nmarkets operate differently, with certain nonmarket phenomenom that\nthe private sector can't handle well (like armies vs. warlords). In\nthat respect, the effects on American society vs. Canadian/European\nsociety might also be different.\n\n\nGood point again.  Blue Cross in the U.S. is quite convoluted compared\nto the Canadian and German insurance funds, which have a minimal\norganization to coordinate it.  If anything, bureaucracy now needs to\nbe built up in Canada to combat fraud, such as Americans crossing the\nborder individually to use insurance cards borrowed from friends and\nrelatives or using phony domestic addresses, or fraud rings stealing\nthem in blocks.  Our private practices are now recording insurance\naccount numbers, both public insurance and private insurance, which\nmost have never bothered to do before on assumption of an honour \nsystem.\n\ngld", '', "I think somebody posted some info about a biobliography program one or \ntwo months ago.

While they had been considered a possible contender when Jacques\nDemers first arrived, in his last two years they were, respectively,\nembarrassed in the first round by Chicago, and then failed to make the \nplayoffs (at a time, a might add, when there were only five teams in the\nNorris).\n\nIt\'s true that Vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before \nQuinn came, but in those years the Smythe Division was a lot--I mean *a lot*--\ntougher division than the Norris, also known as the "Snorris", division.\nVancouver had to play Edmonton and Calgary, both very legitimate Stanley\nCup contenders, eight times a year, while Detroit got to play such \npowerhouses as Toronto and Minnesota.  Now, Edmonton is hardly even a force\nin the league, and the Smythe even has the mighty San Jose sharks, while\nover this same period of time in which Vancouver was improving, so was \neverybody in the Norris (except St. Louis).  Detroit had to improve just\nto keep up with the competition in their division.  They had to improve *a\nlot* to get better than their competition in the Norris.\n\nBryan Murray inherited a team with very little talent.  For really good\nplayers, they had Yzerman, Burr, and Probert, and that was about it.  (And\nno doubt some will dispute whether Burr and Probert were that good). The\nrest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans.  The only reason\nthey got as far as they did in the years before Murray came was due to the\ncoaching of Demers, who, at least at first, got every last ounce of effort\npossible out of his team.  Then, even his coaching began to degrade.\n\n\nThere are a number of reasons why Detroit wasn\'t in as bad a shape standings\nwise when Murray took over as Vanc. was when Quinn took over, some of which\nI outlined above, but Murray did not have any better personnel to work with\nat the outset than did Quinn, with the exception of Yzerman.  And one player\ncannot alone make a team into a Stanley Cup contender, as I\'m sure everyone\nreading this will agree.  \n\nWe\'ll be able to see better which team is really the most improved when they\nface each other in the conference final (assuming they don\'t get knocked out,\nlike last year).\n', "I've been troubleshooting the existence of way too many General Protection\nFaults on a 486-33, Eisa-VLB, system.

But I don't really\nthink that's what he's saying anyway.  See below.\n\n\n   What about the letter to Philemon?  In it Paul at least hints that a\ncertain slave be released.

Anyway, although it does demonstrate your\npoint, I don't think it is relevent, because the original poster did not\nsay that absence of specific condemenation proves something is not\nimmoral.\n\n   Back to the original poster's assertion.  He is not in fact making\nthe logical error of which you accuse him.  He stated the fact that the\nBible does not say that babies cannot be baptized.  Also, we know that\nthe Bible says that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven.\n_Everyone_ includes infants, unless there is other Scripture to the\ncontrary, i.e. an exception.  Since there is no exception listed in the\nBible, we must assume (to be on the safe side) that the Bible means what\nit says, that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven.  And so we\nbaptize infants.\n\n   To summarize, you accused the original poster of saying if something\nis not forbidden by the Bible, then that proves it is OK; i.e. if\nsomething cannot be disproven, it is true.  He rather seemed to be\nasserting that since the Bible does not forbid, _you cannot prove_,\nusing the Bible, that it is _not_ OK.  There is a difference between\nproving whether or not something can be proven or disproven (there are\ntheories on provability in the field of Logic, by the way) and actually\nproving or disproving it.  The other logical error we must avoid falling\ninto is the converse: that if something cannot be proven, then it is\nfalse.

Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final\nresting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever\nclaimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why?\nBecause everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.\n\nAlthough there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of\nMary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation\nthat describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned\nin the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other\ninterpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.\n\nThe assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to\nChrist.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the\nrequirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we\nare to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his\nmother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he\ntook his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to\nallow her flesh to rot in the grave.\n\nOne last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine\non the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary\ndid not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe.\nThe dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying\nwhether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic\ntheologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die.

Suddenly there \nwas a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer \nripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We \nswung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon \nunder our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.\n\nWe had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round \nagain, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a \nvalley.

We had, in \nfact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. \nI had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window, \nits cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on \n"our side". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a \nsearch-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.\n\nOur flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two \nM24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed \nflying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second \ncrocodile. The civilian helicopter\'s job was to land in the mountains \nand pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters \nwere there to give covering fire if necessary.\n\nThe operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet \narmed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani \nofficial told us that there were now five former Soviet military \nhelicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. "They have \nsigned contracts to fly for us," he said. The helicopter we engaged \nin combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian \npilot, but fighting for the Armenians.\n\nWe had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an \nheated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer \nwhite wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four \ncorpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an \nAzerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies \non the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back \ntowards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before \nthe plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.\n\nBack at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the \ncivilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were \ncovered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor \nmortis.

His ultimate will (the reconcilication of all\nhumankind) will never be stopped.\n\nTime after time, Weatherhead used the Cross as the best description of\nthis process at work.  His points, paraphrased, were 1) God\'s\nintentional will was for Jesus, the Christ, to live out a full life\nand perform the work of the Living God.  2) The failures, sins, and\ndeviousness of humankind frustrated God\'s intent for His Son.  3)\nDespite the circumstance, God\'s ultimate will was revealed in the\nCross, as Jesus willingly ("not my will, Lord, but yours") died for\nthe redemption of all humankind.  The Cross was utterly triumphant,\novercoming even the most cruel of circumstances.\n\n\nIt was not the intentional will of God.

Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.\n\nThe day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy\nMarshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although\nSpence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy\nmust involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is\nthe government\'s only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.\nSpence attacked Cooper\'s credibility by pointing out discrepancies\nbetween Cooper\'s statements last September and those made in court.\nCooper conceded that, "You have all these things compressed into\na few seconds...It\'s difficult to remember what went on first."\n\nCooper acknowledged that he carried a "9mm Colt Commando submachine\ngun with a silenced barrel." [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]\nCooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific\nplans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver\'s dog.\n\nWhen Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan\'s\nM-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for\nsure that Degan did not return fire before going down.\n\nSpence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)\nhad Cooper discussed last August\'s events, Cooper responded, "If\nyou\'re implying that we got our story together, you\'re wrong,\ncounselor."  Spence continued to advance the defense\'s version of\nthe events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by\nkilling the Weaver\'s dog.  Cooper disagreed.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence\'s\nvirulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions\nwere repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained \nthat Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the\ndefense\'s version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge\nsustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted\nuntil Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to\nadmonish both attorneys.  "I\'m not going to play games with either\ncounsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start\nacting like professionals."\n\nSpence told the judge that, "When all the evidence is in, we\'ll see\nthat ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that\nhe was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events." \nSpence continued, "We\'re going to find...that there is a very unlikely\nsimilarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between\nthe testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses."\n\nSpence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen\'s repeated\nobjections would prevent a fair trial, "We can\'t have a fair trial if the\njury believes I\'m some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I\'m\nbending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I\'m\nviolating court orders."\n\nJudge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen\'s\nobjections had somehow prejudiced the jury was "preposterous" and\ndenied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict\nhis comments when objecting.\n\nThe trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg\nRampton.  The prosecution\'s purpose was simply to introduce five\nweapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized\non the opportunity to further address Cooper\'s credibility.\n\nDefense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris\' other attorney) questioned\nRampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific\nplans to kill the Weaver\'s dog without being detected.

On April 22 and 23, delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes were\nperformed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43\n(Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  Initial results \nindicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground\nstation hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.\n\n2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the\nMagnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received\nproperly.\n\n3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the\nspacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS\n(Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to\npreclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a\nsource of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).\n\n4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\nproperly.\n\n5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle was\nperformed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of\ntwo-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the\nspacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.\n\n6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay\nAntenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28.\nThe RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately\n20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18\ndegrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back\nto approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the\nantenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The\nRRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had\nincreased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.\n\n     After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was\nuplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink,\na Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on\nMay 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the\nTwo-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test\nmini-sequence.\n\n7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\n\n8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under\nstored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees\nfrom stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees,\nback to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of\nthe slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was\nat 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4\ndegrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time\ncommands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.\n\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN\n(3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\nanomaly team.\n\n10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:\n\n       a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees\n           off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\n           acceptable range\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\n           acceptable range\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\n           Time To Initiation - 203 hours\n\n\nGDS (Ground Data Systems):\n\n1.  The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) took\nplace April 27, 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test went\nwell and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN\n(Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test was\nsuccessful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1, 1993 with\nDSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna).\n\n2.  The April System Engineers Monthly Report(SEMR)/Ground System Development\nOffice (GSDO) MMR was conducted Thursday, April 29.   A review of current\nProject and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.  On-going\ncruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past months\naccomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  No significant\nschedule changes or significant problems were reported.\n\n\nTRAJECTORY\n\n     As of noon Thursday, April 29, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\nstatus was as follows:\n\n\tDistance from Earth         187,745,300 km (1.26 AU)\n\tDistance from Sun           296,335,800 km (1.98 AU)\n\tHeliocentric Speed          89,100 km per hour\n\tDistance from Jupiter       522,015,800 km\n\tRound Trip Light Time       20 minutes, 58 seconds\n\nSPECIAL TOPIC', "Hi.

They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on\n    microfilm.\n\n    The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it\n    is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960\'s vintage hardware (like\n    guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB\n    have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch\n    from.\n\n    By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify\n    the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean\n    sheet design.\n\n\n    WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN\'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE\n\n    Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access\n    for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an\n    opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being\n    "scooped" by people uninvolved in the mission.

Numerous studies claim that even in\n    worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental\n    reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.\n    Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2\n    RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather\n    satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months\n    with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar\n    module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which\n    was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in\n    the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are\n    expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10\n    half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].\n\n    To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to\n    pursue are:\n\n    A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel\n    Salisbury in "Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG\n    Controversy," *Planetary Report*, May-June 1987, pages 3-7.

Studies\n    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in\n    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The\n    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted\n    study, Charles Jackman.\n\n    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the\n    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was\n    organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space\n    Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia\n    (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space\n    Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and\n    Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects\n    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.\n\n    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:\n\n       Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year\n\t  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year\n\t  Shuttle sources:\t  725,000 kilograms/year\n\n    The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are\n    launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the\n    total stratospheric chlorine sources.\n\n    The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would\n    be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability\n    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.\n\n    The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed\n    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally\n    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and\n    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch\n    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be\n    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about\n    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons\n    do at the present time.\n\n    Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space\n    Shuttle\'s Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR\n    Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W.

Holding your\n    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to\n    watch out for when ascending, and you\'ll have eardrum trouble if your\n    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal\n    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no\n    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do\n    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.\n\n    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly "the bends", certainly some\n    [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)\n    start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from\n    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,\n    you\'re dying. The limits are not really known.\n\n    References:\n\n    _The Effect on the Chimpanzee of Rapid Decompression to a Near Vacuum_,\n    Alfred G.

Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School\n    of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.\n\n\n    HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED\n\n    The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is\n    a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.\n    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank\n    came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the\n    astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin\n    team\'s medical/forensic report.\n\n    The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the\n    water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks\n    underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team\n    examined them, they were sent off to be buried.\n\n\n    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT\n\n    You can\'t use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit\n    because it can\'t get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry\n    enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.\n\n    Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of\n    that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in\n    the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly\n    specialized for travel between Earth\'s surface and low orbit. Taking it\n    higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would\n    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit\n    spacecraft.\n\n    [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]\n\n\n    THE "FACE ON MARS"\n\n    There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid\n    face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:\n    35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often\n    published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13\n    (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).\n\n    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is\n    artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an\n    extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the\n    resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a\n    smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere\n    on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don\'t\n    know the address) to study the Face.\n\n    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution\n    camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this\n    question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is\n    best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or\n    sci.astro.\n\n    V. DiPeitro and G.

It was an article written by the leader of a\nnational (US) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made\nto Jerusalem. While there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is\nworking on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The article\nincluded photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in\npreparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the\nspecifications given in the Bible. \n\nWhat was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are\ncomplete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli\ngovernment before beginning the building. The other startling fact is the\nvery recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is\nunoccupied and available for building.

In escence,\nthe detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes (one on each of the\nfour sides of the square detector crystal) and a single anode (the back of\nthe crystal).  A spot of light will produce currents which are proportional\nto the position of the spot on the detector\'s face.

Some of what I \nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \nin an afterlife.  \n\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \n\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \none weekend, "getting away from it all" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \nmiles to the east.  (Their \'security light\' didn\'t help matters \nmuch either.)  But I\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \n\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\'t \nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\'ve been TRYING this forever - \nlike, concerning Tesla\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\'t watch \ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \nIf ya\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \n\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\'ll be trying to see it \nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \neven if it can\'t ever be perfectly achieved. ', "\n\nUnfortunately, that is the way the league is heading...

However, expressing\n    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well\n    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far\n    exceed their technical skills.\n\n    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression\n    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and\n    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the\n    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of\n    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar\n    representions, a confounded user asks: "What does it all mean?"\n\n    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and\n    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by\n    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media\n    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic\n    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for\n    composing imagery for understanding.\n\n    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a\n    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the\n    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,\n    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and\n    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the\n    computer graphics context.\n\n\n    FEATURED SPEAKERS INCLUDE:\n\n        Psychology/Perception:\n            Marc De May, University of Ghent\n            Beverly J.

First, what is faith?  If you study the \nmeaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will\ncome to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere \nbelief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your \nbelief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this \nis what James means when he says that "faith without works is dead" \nand, "I will show you my faith by my works."  Remember James was \nwriting to "the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad."  This \nprobably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much \nlater and wouldn\'t understand the meaning of the original Greek.\n(Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others he\nintended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the\npeople of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of\nthe Greek.\n\nAnother key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul\'s\nstatements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paul\ncontrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the\ngospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the great\nburden of Paul\'s life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go\nconvert a bunch of people, then the "Judizers" would come along and\ntry to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cf\nActs chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of being\nsaved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the blood\nof Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translation\nfor today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think\n"faithfulness" today has a meaning closer to what the original\nwriters intended.\n\n\nI think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying is\nthat God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not "keep kosher" to a\nkosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters\nof following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.\n\n\nIn the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and \nbe lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are \nworse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus in\nthe parable of the pearl of great price (Mat 13:45-46) and again in\nthe one on the treasure hidden in the field (Mat 13:44) indicates that\nthe price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.\n\n[I agree with you in general, including the fact that "pistis" has\nsome of the force of "faithful".  However if you take that too far,\nyou can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have\nintended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To say\nthat we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we\nare saved by commiting no sins.  I assume that\'s not what you meant.\n\nI have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that\ncompletely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what I\'d\ncall a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust and\ncommitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basic\nchange.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to show\nthe new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in any\nChristian there had better be the basic change in orientation that\nJesus calls being born again.', '\nUm. Would you mind telling us what state/municipality you live in?

And no Muslim country was doing\nmuch of anything to help liberate Kuwait and protect Saudi\nArabia; indeed, in some masses of citizens were demonstrating\nin favor of that butcher Saddam (who killed lotsa Muslims),\njust because he was killing, raping, and looting relatively\nrich Muslims and also thumbing his nose at the West.\n\nSo how would have *you* defended Saudi Arabia and rolled\nback the Iraqi invasion, were you in charge of Saudi Arabia???\n\n\nI think that it is a very good idea to not have governments have an\nofficial religion (de facto or de jure), because with human nature\nlike it is, the ambitious and not the pious will always be the\nones who rise to power.

The NYT reported that, besides complaining that the\ngovernment was not conservative enough, they have:\n\n\t- asserted that the (approx. 500,000) Shiites in the Kingdom\n\t  are apostates, a charge that under Saudi (and Islamic) law\n\t  brings the death penalty.  \n\n\t  Diplomatic guy (Sheikh bin Jibrin), isn't he Ilyess?\n\n\t- called for severe punishment of the 40 or so women who\n\t  drove in public a while back to protest the ban on\n\t  women driving.  The guy from the group who said this,\n\t  Abdelhamoud al-Toweijri, said that these women should\n\t  be fired from their jobs, jailed, and branded as\n\t  prostitutes.\n\n\t  Is this what you want to see happen, Ilyess?  I've\n\t  heard many Muslims say that the ban on women driving\n\t  has no basis in the Qur'an, the ahadith, etc.\n\t  Yet these folks not only like the ban, they want\n\t  these women falsely called prostitutes?  \n\n\t  If I were you, I'd choose my heroes wisely,\n\t  Ilyess, not just reflexively rally behind\n\t  anyone who hates anyone you hate.\n\n\t- say that women should not be allowed to work.\n\n\t- say that TV and radio are too immoral in the Kingdom.\n\nNow, the House of Saud is neither my least nor my most favorite government\non earth; I think they restrict religious and political reedom a lot, among\nother things.  I just think that the most likely replacements\nfor them are going to be a lot worse for the citizens of the country.\nBut I think the House of Saud is feeling the heat lately.  In the\nlast six months or so I've read there have been stepped up harassing\nby the muttawain (religious police---*not* government) of Western women\nnot fully veiled (something stupid for women to do, IMO, because it\nsends the wrong signals about your morality).

Blackman, Research Coordinator for\nNRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDear sir:\n\nBy now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine\'s publication\nof small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are\ndrawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of \nmomentus "scientific" findings. These are regularly released to the press\nwithout the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and\noften accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings.\nGenerally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however\nmeaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle\nserious studies by criminologists.\n\nThe latest effort -- "Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide:\nA Tale of Two Cities," by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying \neditorial, "Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science," by two employees\nof the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult\nto the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few\ndata and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length\nto call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular\norder.\n\n\t1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to \n\tsupport the statement that "some have argued that restricting\n\taccess to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate\n\tof homicide." Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that\n\tcontention.\n\t\n\t2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very\n\tsimilar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,\n\tdemographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities\n\tare very different with very different demographic characteristics\n\twhich appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in\n\tSeattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white\n\tand *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be\n\tthe same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-\n\tgrounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various\n\tethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.\n\t\n\t3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada\'s gun law,\n\tcompared to Washington State\'s. But they do not examine at all\n\tthe situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect\n\tin 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-\n\t1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth\n\tinvolving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM\n\tarticle there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving\n\thandguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that\n\tone must look to see the prior situation was before concluding\n\tthat a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that\n\ta patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day\n\tfor seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without\n\tat least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?\n\t\n\t4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national\n\tgun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily\n\tselected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because\n\tit was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific\n\treason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which\n\tinvolved one experimental subject and one dissimilar "control"?\n\tHad different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite\n\t"scientific" conclusions would follow: Vancouver\'s homicide\n\trate *exceeds* that of such "wild west" cities in Texas as\n\tEl Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado\n\tSprings. (Ref. 3)\n\t\n\t5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or\n\thandguns "are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in\n\tVancouver." They use two surrogate approaches in pretending\n\tto study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is\n\tan apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry\n\tpermits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in\n\tVancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of\n\thandguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun\n\towners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number\n\tof handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns\n\tfor the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns\n\tlegally for protection, registration figures are\n\tmeaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York\n\tCity (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,\n\tthat method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population\n\tin New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver\n\thas a greater "prevalence of weapons" than New York City.\n\t\n\tThe second method of measuring gun density is "Cook\'s gun\n\tprevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity\n\tdifferences." But the validation was by Cook of his own\n\ttheory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a\n\tdifferent doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is\n\tbased on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement\n\tin suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking\n\ta measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide\n\t(42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in\n\thomicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in\n\tVancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-\n\tability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and\n\tVancouver.\n\t\n\t6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and\n\tCanada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that\n\tWashington has a waiting period and background check prior to\n\tthe purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian\n\tlaw for owning and carrying handguns for personal\n\tprotection. The authors also make it appear that it is more\n\tdifficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually\n\tthe case.\n\t\n\t7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain\n\tthe differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the\n\tpenalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of \n\tclearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a\n\tfirearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number\n\tof law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making\n\tarrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest\n\trates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences\n\timposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,\n\tor gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social\n\tscientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,\n\tthe authors of the NEJM "tale of two cities" fail even to mention\n\tmost factors related to crime control.\n\t\n\t8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective\n\tmeans for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not\n\tthe case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost\n\t650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from\n\tcriminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the\n\tliklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be\n\tcompleted by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury\n\tto the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors\n\treported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides\n\twithout firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle\n\taccounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides\n\tinvolving firearms.\n\t\n\t9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the "study,"\n\teditorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it "applied\n\tscientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb\n\tadvocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly\n\thandguns." There is nothing in the paper which could possibly\n\tbe mistaken for "scientific methods" by a sociologists or\n\tcriminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle "study" is the equivolent\n\tof testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding\n\ttwo ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25\n\tand the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,\n\tadministering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while\n\tgiving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure\n\tand, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure, \n\tannouncing in a "special article" a new medical breakthrough.\n\tIt would be nice to think that such a "study" would neither be\n\tfunded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.\n\t\n\tSince the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC\n\tmake them willing to present shoddy research as "scientific\n\tbreakthroughs" in "special articles" and editorials relating\n\tto firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying\n\tthe news media and those with congressional and executive oversight\n\tover the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about\n\tthe distortions contained in "Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,\n\tand Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities" and "Firearm Injuries: A Call\n\tfor Science." Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside\n\twhenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize\n\tan opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tREFERENCES\n\n1.

Wright\n          (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)\n\n   suggestive, but what they conceal is vital."  The problem is demonstrated\n   by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting\n   to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by\n   the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal\n   of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and\n   suggested that a handgun ban "may reduce the rate of homicide in a \n   community."\n      The nine medical doctors who published "Handgun Regulations, Crime,\n   Assaults, and Homicide" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite\n   many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver\n   has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations\n   make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems\n   indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period\n   1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.\n   Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,\n   Why?\n      The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case\n   to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,\n   that Vancouver\'s handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their\n   evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and \n   unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point\n   does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support\n   of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody\n   knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We\n   are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that\n   a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates\n   when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.\n      Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two\n   indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-\n   weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons\n   permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the\n   permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable.\n*     The second bit of evidence is "Cook\'s gun prevalence index," which stands\n*  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook\'s index\n*  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in \n*  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage\n*  of homicides and suicides involving firearms.\n*     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides,\n*  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take\n*  Cook\'s index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be\n*  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides\n*  is directly related to their relative availability in the general \n*  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To\n*  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to "prove" it on the basis of\n*  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.\n      Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that\n   guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.\n   The authors attribute Seattle\'s higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun\n   ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates\n   reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,\n   that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.\n      In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain\'s low rate of\n   violent crime was a function of that nation\'s strict gun laws and the \n   consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin \n   Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime\n   for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke\n   an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.\n      Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data\n   on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are "similar in\n   many ways," implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law\n   stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish\n   the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that "all\n   else is equal" among things being compared.\n*     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look \n*  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime\n*  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage\n*  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle\n*  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent.\n*  Vancouver\'s minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the\n*  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half-\n*  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown\n*  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out.\n*     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is\n*  particularly relevant in light of the study\'s breakdown of homicide rates\n*  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide\n*  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver.\n*  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due\n*  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks,\n*  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics\n*  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison\n*  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial\n*  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle\n*  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain\n*  in either city.\n      Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the\n   cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority \n   groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in "gun availability"\n   (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not\n   matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why\n   blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed\n   in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,\n   do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)\n      Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between\n   Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have \n   anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol \n   abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty\'s minority population?  (The city\n   of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the \n   Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the\n   United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian\n   percentage?\n      The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many\n   ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent\n   more detailed analysis, nearly any of these "many ways" might explain part\n   or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such\n   as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal.\n*     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide\n*  result in a "complex picture."  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing\n*  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They\n*  also acknowledge that "socio-economic status is probably an important\n*  confounding factor in our comparison," remarking further that "blacks   \n*  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of\n*  Vancouver\'s population."  Given the evidence presented in the article,\n*  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle\n*  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle\'s racial\n*  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility,\n*  since "detailed information about household incomes according to race\n*  is not available for Vancouver."\n      The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in \n   gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple\n   example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms\n   of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one \n   would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.\n   Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce \n   crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into\n   account?  In this example, the "hidden variable" is city size: Guns are\n   more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city\n   problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the\n   appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very\n   seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities\n   for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,\n   and their results are impossible to interpret.\n      In the editorial "Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science" accompanying\n   the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the\n   authors for applying "scientific methods" to a problem of grave public\n   heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from\n   nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate\n   plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them\n   out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are\n   little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this\n   study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical\n   identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--\n   is cause for further concern.\n\n   [James D.

Put another way, the question is whether homosexual\nintercourse is the only act that Christians are supposed to believe\nis immoral solely on the basis that God says it is, with no insight\nbeing offered as to *why* it is immoral.

Incest is held to be immoral in every society,\nthat is, there are some degrees of relationship where marriage\n(and thus, intercouse) is prohibited. The Bible is no exception.\nThe trouble is that it may be difficult to see *why* a particular\nrelationship qualifies as incestuous. Societies differ as to\nhow they define incest. Genetic reasons are sometimes offered, but\nall the Biblical cases cannot be dealt with that way. Why can\'t\na man sleep with his step mother--assuming that his father is\ndead and that he has "married" her? How does this case differ\nfrom the *duty* to marry one\'s brother\'s childless wife.\n\nAre these two cases parallel?

The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the\n    sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire\n    has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel\n    diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'\n    tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like\n    390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed\n    rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly\n    inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common\n    speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to\n    150MPH.)\n\n    Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed\n    rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find\n    designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load\n    associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous\n    operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is\n    a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum\n    per-tire loads:\n\n    Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157\n    Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125\n\n    Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.\n\n    In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire\n    size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation\n    indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application\n    of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters\n    only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of\n    interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For\n    the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference\n    between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at\n    all.\n\n    If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.\n\n    Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating\n    reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)\n\n    There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,\n    traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded\n    A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is\n    a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they\n    are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are\n    thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.\n\nQ:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put\n    normal tires on the car?\n\nA:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.\n    Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible\n    with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them\n    so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that\n    more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)\n    You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your\n    car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly\n    dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,\n    or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard\n    to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear\n    has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.\n\nQ:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side\n    of my car?\n\nA:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many\n    say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a\n    car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others\n    (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping\n    is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before\n    rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.\n\nQ:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the\n    car should I put them on?\n\nA:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't\n    get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow\n    conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there\n    are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear\n    wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car\n    going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car\n    (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,\n    stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the\n    snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes\n    while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.\n\nRadar Detectors and Speed Limits:\n\nQ:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits\n    in this Q&A posting?\n\nA:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between\n    misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless\n    flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please\n    subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.\n\nSafety Equipment:\n\nQ:  Do airbags really work?\n\nA:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much\n    better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than\n    Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than\n    3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend\n    to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the\n    explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but\n    not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention\n    of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.\n\nBrake Questions:\n\nQ:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas\n    always wants to do this.\n\nA:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing\n    rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors\n    more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped\n    warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or\n    to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas\n    are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical\n    to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,\n    or badly grooved.\n\nQ:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is\n    this really a good idea?\n\nA:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade\n    prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of\n    downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases\n    of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more\n    than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they\n    are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.\n\n    On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA\n    still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I\n    suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to\n    do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a\n    car with an automatic to take the test.\n\nQ:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?\n\nA:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to\n    absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake\n    system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type\n    are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The\n    principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry\n    boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling\n    point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest\n    wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better\n    boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling\n    point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see\n    the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that\n    DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific\n    cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly\n    competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_\n    improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for\n    DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out\n    fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid\n    out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.\n\nQ:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?\n\nA:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks\n    excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone\n    based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and\n    DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound\n    like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in\n    such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any\n    metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend\n    to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where\n    most of the corrosion occurs.\n\n    Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to\n    Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly\n    beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the\n    brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.\n\n    Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are\n    difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which\n    interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they\n    generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they\n    do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable\n    in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense\n    in some street car applications, but they are certainly not\n    recommended for high performance driving applications, and the\n    economics are questionable for street use.\n\n    I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard\n    that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably\n    compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little\n    information at this time.\n\nQ:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs\n    more.  Is it worth it?\n\nA:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will\n    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer\n    is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally\n    work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does\n    not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),\n    and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques\n    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.\n\n    Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the\n    car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able\n    be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several\n    systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is\n    what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence\n    of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed\n    sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and\n    may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original\n    equipment or OE-equivalent components.\n\n    When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking\n    the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the\n    system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS\n    will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a\n    sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could\n    sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is\n    achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as\n    the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are\n    truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system\n    this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this\n    duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;\n    on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform\n    threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on\n    snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes\n    locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,\n    has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this\n    eventuality.\n\n    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves\n    steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are\n    braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release\n    the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off\n    on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.\n    Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.\n\n    An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical\n    braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on\n    glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.\n    The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an\n    ABS system in your car.\n\n    As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential\n    restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the\n    following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder\n    for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master\n    cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for\n    over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5\n    (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of\n    the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system\n    components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid\n    becomes very important.\n\nQ:  What about this threshold braking business?\n\nA:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent\n    publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers\n    in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is\n    needed here -- rpw]\n\n    Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high\n    performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab\n    the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much\n    to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate\n    maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but\n    just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold\n    brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn\n    to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake\n    pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the\n    threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.\n    In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're\n    not very near the threshold.\n\n    In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just\n    before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on\n    the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very\n    close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better\n    stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS\n    take over.\n\n    Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of\n    accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with\n    ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed\n    the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now\n    seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the\n    involved officers had any recent performance driving training.\n    There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing\n    brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique\n    of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to\n    try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you\n    think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must\n    cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least\n    1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that\n    much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.\n    Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective\n    and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if\n    you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at\n    the pedal will be sufficient.    \n\nGas Questions:\n\nQ:  Does High Octane gasoline help?\n\nA:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the\n    engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.\n    On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your\n    car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car\n    needs.\n\nQ:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?\n\nA:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,\n    although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase\n    in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded\n    gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,\n    check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not\n    actually require leaded gasoline.\n\nQ:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?\n\nA:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use\n    dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.\n    Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl\n    Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs\n    and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.\n\n    Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes\n    called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's\n    manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider\n    10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol\n    (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected\n    cars.\n\n    An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with\n    fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that\n    do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain\n    Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything\n    in your gas tank.\n\n    There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are\n    noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work\n    much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,\n    Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,\n    once every six months, is highly recommended.\n\nQ:  What about detergent gasolines?\n\nA:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW\n    has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this\n    test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test\n    are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such\n    gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.\n    Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean\n    engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.\n\nLubrication Questions:\n\nQ:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?\n\nA:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter\n    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer\t\n    uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are\n    for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine\n    applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels\n    of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,\n    SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.\n\n    The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either\n    a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by\n    the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly\n    used these days, and are the only type that most automobile\n    manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the\n    designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;\n    the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity\n    of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually\n    get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What\n    is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity\n    of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast\n    as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the\n    viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.\n\n    Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not\n    all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all\n    30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the\n    novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has\n    been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils\n    do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,\n    15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.\n\nQ:  Are `quick lube' places any good?\n\nA:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out\n    there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure\n    that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on\n    your wallet at all times.\n\nQ:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?\n\nA:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have\n    come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based\n    additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the\n    chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,\n    auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET\n    responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight\n    increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term\n    results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are\n    debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the\n    product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes\n    deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners\n    have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of\n    Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50\n    Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as\n    it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are\n    no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.\n\n    On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.\n\nQ:  Do synthetic oils really work?\n\nA:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,\n    but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by\n    oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to\n    change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your\n    car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change\n    the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty\n    as conventional oils.\n\n    Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter\n    entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very\n    effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.\n\nQ:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.\n    How often should I change my oil?\n\nA:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)\n    gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs\n    down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,\n    you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you\n    only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up\n    to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,\n    perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are\n    now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car\n    much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change\n    oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,\n    then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out\n    of storage.\n\nMisc. Questions:\n\nQ:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they\n    break.  What's the story?\n\nA:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,\n    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but\n    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.\n    Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.\n\n    If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the\n    belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent\n    replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if\n    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time\n    (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have\n    a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,\n    destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage\n    as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water\n    pump can be a costly mistake.)\n\nQ:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it\n    self destructs when the timing belt breaks?\n\nA:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the\n    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression\n    ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are\n    more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance\n    oriented vehicles.\n\nQ:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?\n\nA:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety\n    Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be\n    caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the\n    same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report\n    goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator\n    is probably the cause.", '\n[SB] Oh yeah, Israel was really ready to "expand its borders" on the holiest day\n[SB] of the year (Yom Kippur) when the Arabs attacked in 1973.

My definition\nis this: Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids\nmistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous\n\n\nUnless one classifies "thinking and informal exploration" as a\nmistake, they fall under my definition.  I hope no one would\nconsider speculation, thinking, and informal exploration as\nunscientific.  \n\n\nHere is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes.  It is not\nclear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be\ntaken as describing what "science is mainly about."  Consider,\nfor example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking\na backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and\nwhat is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what\ninvertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and\nstill not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates,\nthat invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that\nsome invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are\nubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the\ndefinition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are\n"mainly about."\n\nThe misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient\ncontext for people to understand my proposed definition.\n\n\nI agree on both counts.  As an example of the second, it would only\ntake a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians\nthat a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.  \n\nAs to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about\n"absolute scientific truth."  I think it is more useful to talk\nabout the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the\nkinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have\nproven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of\ndegree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the\nrelevance of different kinds of evidence.  \n\nOne of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as\npsuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion\nregarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim,\nthe kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the\nhistorical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence\nare given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to\nspeculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that\nspeculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to\nidentify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence\nwas presently available for them, and to describe how research\ncould proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to\nuncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper\nof this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the\nauthor sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (It\nis in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.)\n\n\nI think a lot of scientists steer away from things that --\ndeserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness.  When\nproponents of some practice see no value in more careful\ninvestigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many\nresearchers\' minds.  \n\nThis is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some\nintersection between things that are worth investigating and\nthings that are advocated by those who seem careless or\nunreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I can\nunderstand why many scientists would just as soon select other\ndirections for research.  As Gordon Banks has pointed out, no one\nwants to become this generation\'s Rhine.\n\n\nI think this is absurd.  \n\n\nI wonder why the results were not published.  In my field,\ndissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are\nsubmitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted for\npublication before the dissertation is finished.

The three of us served as governors \ntogether during the 1980s when we worked constantly on strategies to \nimprove our schools, when we led often difficult and long efforts to \nupgrade the standards in American education and to improve the \nquality of instruction our children were receiving.  \n\t     \n\t     There were no two governors whom I admired more during \nthat period than the two who now stand on this stage with the Teacher \nof the Year.  And I think both of them would join me in saying that, \nafter all the testimony has been heard and all the bills have been \npassed and the funds have been raised and allocated, it all comes \ndown to what happens between the teacher and the students in the \nclassroom.\n\t     \n\t     That's why today's ceremony honoring the National \nTeacher of the Year is so important.  Tracey Leon Bailey is one \nrecognition all across our country for highly advanced and innovative \nscience programs.  He's developed and introduced into Florida's \nclassrooms cutting-edge programs in molecular biology and DNA \nfingerprinting -- subjects usually taught only in college and, I \nmight add, probably only dimly understood here in the Nation's \nCapital.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Within three years of being hired by a satellite high \nschool, Mr. Bailey's institution had one of the strongest science \nprograms in the entire state of Florida, and it won numerous national \nand international awards.  These advanced programs aren't just for a \nfavored few.  Tracey Bailey has inspired all kinds of students, \nincluding those previously known as low-achieving or at-risk to reach \nfor excellence and to attain it.  This is what our students need and \nwhat our country needs. \n\t     \n\t     Today, we know that a good future with high wages and \nrich opportunities rests on the foundation of quality education for a \nlifetime.  The basics aren't enough anymore.  All our kids need \ncompetence in math and science and advanced problem-solving.  That's \nwhy Tracey Bailey's accomplishments are so important and why I am so \npleased and proud to participate in recognizing and honoring these \naccomplishments. \n\t     \n\t     Tracey, you represent the best in the United States.  \nI'm glad to recognize you today and to formally present you with this \nApple Award as the Teacher of the Year for 1993.  (Applause.)  \n\t     \n\t     MR. BAILEY:  Thank you, Mr. President.  It is indeed a \ngreat honor and a tremendous responsibility to represent the nation's \n2.5 million teachers.  And we appreciate the support that you have \nshown for education, and we're looking forward to working with you to \nhelp redesign and improve our nation's schools.  \n\t     \n\t     We know that the quality of our children's education \nwill directly impact the future of our economic and social landscape \nin the years to come.  And we thank you so much for your continued \nsupport and commitment to our children's education.  Thank you again.  \n(Applause.)\n\n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  In closing, I would like to also welcome \nthe education leaders in Florida who are here, those representing the \nnational education groups who have also come.  I'd like to recognize \nTracey's congressman, Representative Jim Bacchus in the back, himself \na great advocate of education.  And I'd like to remind all of you \nthat the ultimate purpose of the National Teacher of the Year Award \nis to find a way for the rest of us to express our appreciation to \npeople all across this country who give their lives to our children, \nall of the teachers of this country who get up every day and do their \nbest to try to advance the cause of learning for all the children of \nAmerica.  They are, in so many ways, our most important public \nservants.\n\t     \n\t     Thank you very much.

Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company\'s\nplant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to\nwhich came first, the plaintiff\'s acquisition of the land or he\ndefendant\'s start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course\nof its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the\nplaintiffs\' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the\nplant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked\nthe court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.\n\n(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned\ntheir property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.\nAtlantic Cement\'s actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)\n\nInstead of granting the plaintiffs\' request for an injunction, the court\nordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided\nthat Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In\nother words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the\npower and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment\nof their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is\nalways problematical even when it\'s done by the state; allowing a\nprivate firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.\n\n(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn\'t call it eminent domain.  But if\nit walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks\nlike eminent domain...)\n\nLet me take issue with the way you\'ve presented the case... you say that\n"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn\'t allow the\nplaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million\ndollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages."  Blackmail?\n\n    (Pulls out Black\'s Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....\n    "Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to\n    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose\n    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under\n    extortion statutes.")\n\nHow do you define as "blackmail" one party\'s act of demanding the right\nto set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns\nand which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of\ndemanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see\nit, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of\nowning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to\nstay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price\nthey wanted.  There isn\'t, or at least shouldn\'t be, any law that says\nthat you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.\n\nYou go on to say: "The plant would never have been shut down -- the\nplaintiff\'s lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,\nbecause the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to\nhaving the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less\nthan the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation."\n\nIf so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\nbusiness of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from\nother parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those\nother parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn\'t want to have to face a choice\nbetween paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,\nshouldn\'t Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_\nbusiness?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_\nthe parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was\nAtlantic Cement\'s own fault for choosing to build and operate the type\nof plant they did where and when they did.)\n\nAnd then you say: "Everyone\'s property rights were protected; the\nplaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided."\nAs above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were "made whole."\nThey were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners\nof property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price\nacceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made\nwhole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\nbusiness of ensuring that "unnecessary" settlement costs are avoided?\n(If so, I\'ve been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were\nsupposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)\n\n\n(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as "infamous," at least not at my\nschool.\n\n(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for\ntheir first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first\nencountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal\nopinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students get\ninto their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick\nand choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional\nResponsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly\nand self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously\nintimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly\nbiased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors\ntend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This is\nespecially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are\npracticing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_\neducational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat\ncloistered scholar.  End of aside.)\n\nI called it infamous because that\'s my opinion of it.  For the reasons\nI\'ve stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can\nonly call "economic correctness" over justice.\n\n(2) It is "completely sensible" only if you believe that the alleged\nright of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid\nlosing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and\nthe alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to\nnot have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who\nown property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement\'s wrongful acts.\n(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other\nbranch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take\nother people\'s property by eminent domain.)\n\n\nReally?  I didn\'t know that... what, if anything, has he had to say\nabout cases like _Boomer_?\n\n\nI\'ve admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to\nas "law and economics" is weak.  If it advocates the use of economical\nanalysis as one of many "tie-breaker" factors which courts may use to\nhelp them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by\nthe scale of "justice", is evenly balanced, fine.  But as illustrated by\n_Boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics\nof a case as being more important than the justice of a case.', '\nHave you read the applicable part of the Constitution and interpreted it IN \nCONTEXT?

Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of\nreligion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a "real"\nstory (that is, a bigger headline).\n\nLet\'s back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the\nvarious targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the\nSeptuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the\nstandard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has\nobvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy.\nThese passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and\nto the Septuagint.\n\nNow, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars:\nfirst, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are\nvariant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to "fixing"/predating\nthe various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of\nmy knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and\nhave little theological import.\n\nThe dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of\nIsaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There\nis also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no\nsign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the\nseptuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations\nbetween the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the\nseptuagint, where the latter isn\'t obviously in error.  Again, though, the\ndifferences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big\nexpectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the\nmaterial, but so far this hasn\'t happened.\n\nThe DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the\nOT, unlike for the NT.']
