baseUrl = the current page
subUrl = link found on the current page in the 'a' tag 'href' attribute

We may want to visit the page referenced by the subUrl. To make the sub url a valid url we must do the following:
Either:
resultantUrl = baseUrl + subUrl (This is the concatenation of two strings)
or
from urlparse import urljoin(baseUrl, subUrl)

Note that both of these resultant urls refer to the same page, but the first contains redundant information. Therefore it is better to use the second approach.

Using a queue:
(FIFO ADT)
queue = list()
queue.append(<data>)	#Enqueue data.
queue.pop(0)		#Return and remove first element in queue.
